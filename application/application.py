The question hour is an essential mechanism in the Lok Sabha where Members of Parliament question ministers on various topics, particularly on accountability and implementation of policies.

In the context of these discussions, several ministers and Members of Parliament are involved. Key figures include Rahul Gandhi, a leading opposition member from the Indian National Congress, often questioning the governmentâ€™s policies, and Nirmala Sitharaman, the Finance Minister, responsible for defending the budget and outlining the governmentâ€™s economic policies. However, many other ministers across various departments are also central to these debates, either presenting or defending specific proposals.

The texts still contain errors related to grammar, regional accents, incorrect numbers, and out-of-context words. Although the questions were generated from corrected text, your answers should be based on the provided transcripts, taking care to verify and correct any statistics or specific details mentioned. Aim to provide a clear, accurate, and well-informed response. Include any relevant web results if they help substantiate your answer.
