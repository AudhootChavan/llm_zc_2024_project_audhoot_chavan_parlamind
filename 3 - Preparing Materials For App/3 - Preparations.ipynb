    "Summaries - First we will create summaries of the videos in our knowledge base. We can use those summaries in our app to help the user get better context about the project and also ask better questions to the RAG. We used a function to split the entire text for each video into 2 sections, summarise each and then construct a final summary of both. This is essential because the texts are long and can breach the token limit. <br>\n",
    "Query rewriting function - We will rewrite user's question/query using llm. We can create a summary of all summaries we created in section 1 to help us construct a prompt that will make sure the rewritten question is relevant to our RAG. <br>\n",
    "Reranking - Here we are implementing a mechanism to rerank and give us better matches from the retrieval system. We will use the llm for reranking as well. We will get k=10 nearest neighbors and ask the llm to rerank and select top 5 for us. "

Anyway it was said, Jeeve Sarada Satam, I want to say that to save the farmers of the country from such unfortunate situations, many schemes have been started under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Honorable Speaker Sir, the income of the farmers should be doubled and for this we have a six-point strategy. One is to increase the production, second is to reduce the cost of production, third is to give fair price for the production, fourth, in case of natural disaster, the government compensates the loss through schemes like crop insurance and gives relief, starting schemes like diversification of crops and natural farming and that is why I say. That the government is fully committed to the welfare of the farmers, planned efforts are being made to increase the income and many efforts have been made to ensure that the farmers get fair prices.'\",\n",

       " \"2. 'FM Nirmala Sitharamans Reply On Union Budget | Criticism about not mentioned in the budget speech I don't want to say that other things have come down and legal guarantee for MSP This has also been spoken by Moran 20 speakers have spoken 20 members have spoken I just said I don't know minister Shivraj ji Been answering lot of questions related to agriculture last few days they may be some rep in my statement but I like to highlight so the budget allocation for the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare was only Rs 2134 crores in 2013 14 131 crores only Rs 2134 crores Allocation for agriculture but now in 2425 it has increased from 1 lakh 23 lakh to 1.23 lakh crore. Five times increase, Sir Sir, more than 3.2 lakh crores have been dispersed to over 11 crore farmers under the PM Kisan Sins. It's Rs 3.24 Lakh Crore Has Been Dispersed For 11 Crore Farmers So Institutional Credit Targets For Agriculture Have Increased More Than 2.5 Times 2014 15 It Was Rs 8 Lakh Crore Now It Is Rs 20 Lakh Crore Farmers Are Getting This Money Institution Credit Interest Sub Subsidy Is also being given to farmers it has increased 2.4 times. In 201415, farmers used to get loans from banks with interest subsidy of Rs. 6000 crores. Now it has increased to Rs. 14252 crores. Sir, this year 2324 number of accounts of small and marginal farmers are available agricultural loans. Grown from 57 to 76. Agriculture farmers used to take loan at Rs. 57 in 14, now they are taking loan at Rs. 76 with subsidy, that is why this number will increase further because our efforts are going well with the farmer. Sir, also the committee has been consumer how the CACP cost. Agricultural Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices can work better so that how to work in the best possible manner to provide whatever facilities should be available to the farmer, this committee is working on that. Sir I want to highlight if anything I am tired of many of the speakers. Ready Said But I Like To Highlight This Point Today Sir The Congress Party And India's Allies Partners Are Doing Good Lot Of Politics On The Farmers I Say It With Consideration Sir I Am Not Speaking Lose The National Union Farmers M S Swaminathan Had Recommended In 2006 Minimum Support Price should be at Rs 50 per more than the weighted average cost of production This was not accepted by the UPA Government The Cabinet Note was drafted in July 2007 Said and I quote Sir MSP is recommended by the CACP on objective criteria considering the Variety of factors evolved there for setting an increase setting an increase of atleast 50 on the cost may cause distortion in the market in some cases there may be a mechanical linkage between MSP and cost of production On the producer saying this to MS Swaminathan The UPA government side-lined the report in 2007 and again in the 2004 manifesto. Congress party says that it will bring a comprehensive crop insurance, but in reality, who is the PM who will bring PM Fasal Bima Yojana? Sir, our Prime Minister Modi ji, then the Congress party It was also said that it would examine the feasibility of direct income support to farmers, but who is going to bring Kisan Samman Nidhi in 2019? Sir, Honorable Prime Minister Modi ji, that is why Congress party can go on shedding crocodile tires about farmers, no one has done anything in implementation in the last 10 years. Came from the top in a year, got even for several decades, did nothing. The failure of the flagship loan waiver. Sir, wanted to talk about the failure of loan waiver 2008. CAG talked so much about the loan waiver for farmers in the 2008 elections. Found Gross Irregularities in the Implementation of the Rs. 50000 Crore Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Schemes. The CAG report said that around Rs. 164 crore was waved off in the implementation. Congress is the one who is making all the noise on 22nd. Lapses and errors found in 8.5 of the cases Farmers out of account Audited and not eligible to get loan Perhaps brother-in-law, daughter came, hence loans were given as per their wish Some of the measuring criteria were not followed Some of the eligible beneficiaries of the test checked accounts were not Issued Debt Waiver Certificate, I believe that this is a cruel step sir, in which if the bank does not give the certificate, the farmer cannot take the loan again, but in 34 of the eligible cases, that certificate was not even given to him for the loan waiver on which he won in 2009. Today we were crying [praise] for the farmer.'\",\n",

       " \"3. 'LS Question Hour Budget Session | Honorable Chairman, I would like to request through you, please tell me the details of crop insurance. When there was the old crop insurance scheme, the one who was a debtor of the bank at that time could get his insurance. It was done as necessary and the bank automatically deducted the amount of insurance premium. The government removed this discrepancy and made this scheme voluntary. If you wish, then get insured and if you do not wish, do not get insured. This was done forcefully. It is not at all in the scheme, earlier the farmer did not get insurance but now if he wants he can also get insurance and the honorable member was asking how much area has been covered till date, I want to tell him that the area covered till now is That 51000 hectares has been covered, it will increase to 58 thousand hectares in 2023 and 3 crore 97 lakh farmers have been covered. Farmers are continuously working to adopt this crop insurance scheme and the government has taken many measures to simplify it, Honorable Speaker Sir. Due to which the farmer should not face any problem and trouble in availing the benefits of the scheme.'\",\n",

I respect the honorable member, but if he did not understand even such an answer, then I wonder how I should answer, but the farmer is intelligent and I am giving his example. Honorable Speaker, I will also answer his question, but the earlier crop insurance schemes were There were many types of difficulties in them, many crop insurance schemes were also brought by the government there, today there are many questions on this, Honorable Speaker Sir, not only the honorable members, farmers also want to know about many crop insurance schemes, I will not take their names but there were high premiums for the farmers. The one who could not pay, there were insufficient claims, the amount received was less, there was delay in settlement of claims, Honorable Speaker Sir, the farmers and farmer organizations had many types of objections. I am proud to say that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji took the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and only I. I would like to tell you this much, Honorable Speaker Sir, ever since this crop insurance scheme came, please compare, earlier only 3 crore 51 lakh applications were received, but now 8 crore 69 lakh applications have been received because there is trust in the farmers that non-loaney, non-loanee farmers, earlier, the farmers were It is understood that only 20 lakh applications were received when their government was in power, now 5 crore 48 lakh farmer applications have come, when that government was there, 3 crore 71 lakh applications have come, now 14 crore 14 crore 17 lakh have come and the total disbursed amount has increased. 2 crore 7195 crore and I want to say one more thing, I am coming to your point, please Honorable Speaker Sir, it is not a story, it is the truth, premium of Rs 3440 crore has been paid by the farmers and Rs 1 crore 164000 crore has been given to them as claim. Through this crop insurance scheme, as far as the Honorable Speaker Sir Bhanj is also concerned, brother, I am an uncle, I want to give you information, Honorable Member, if the crop gets damaged due to natural reasons, then it is completely covered and the farmer gets its benefit. And the coverage of sharecroppers is also on the basis of certificate from the state government, so don't worry, if the state government certifies then we also cover the sharecroppers and include them in this scheme.'\",\n",

'LS Question Hour Budget Session | Honorable Members Honorable Speaker [Music] [Applause] Yes Question Hour Question No. 18 Rampreet Mandal [Music] [Applause] [Music] Honorable Minister Sir Honorable Finance Minister Honorable Members Speaker Sir We all know that India is an agricultural country and Sir, in the state from where I come, Bihar, most of the farmers do farming in the land that is left due to flood and drought in the rivers, that is why, through you, I want to know from the Honorable Minister that farming farmers are truly given the opportunity to go to the banks. Honorable Finance Minister, Honorable Speaker, our Prime Minister was already the Prime Minister who conceptualized a developed India and if we see, agriculture sector has an important role in making India a developed country and hence Our government has done a lot of work for the brothers for agriculture and farmers, like if we see, more than 52 crore people have been benefited in financial inclusion on the basis of Jan Dhan account, while if we see, this work has been done. As far as the maximum number of accounts were opened in marginal and rural areas, in 2014, where there used to be only 41,000 bank branches, in 10 years, we worked to open 54,000 bank branches in order to reach the banking facilities to the common people. As far as the respondents are concerned, there were only 4 lakh respondents in 2014. In 2004, we have increased it to 11 lakh respondents. Our government has made sure that everyone within a radius of 5 km has access to banking facilities in the country. We should ensure that that facility is available so that people from far and wide can benefit and the result of all this is that if you see, as far as Kisan Credit Card is concerned, in 2014, 426 Kisan Credit worth Rs. 4.26 lakh crore was given. Whereas in 2024, Rs 82 lakh crore is being given to the farmers through Kisan Credit through SSG Bank, but where it was Rs 7.3 lakh, it has been increased to Rs 14481 lakh. Where Rs 1.8 lakh crore was given in rural development, Rs 4 lakh 199 lakh crore was given. Our government is doing the work of giving small loans in the same way through cooperatives where there was a provision of Rs 5437 crores. Now our government has done the work of giving Rs 5.56 lakh crores. Overall, if we look at the ground level credit given in the villages. Till 2014, Rs 7.3 lakh crore was given. Today it has been increased to Rs 25.4 lakh crore in 2024. Somewhere in the village, people are getting the facility. The government will always try to ensure that people can avail it. Honorable member wants to ask a supplementary.'\"]"
