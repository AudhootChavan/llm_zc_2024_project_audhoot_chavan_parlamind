###
1066.64
future Honorable Speaker Sir  When the Honorable Member | 1073.76
talked about the vision and jobs for the disabled people, the | 1077.36
Department of Empowerment of Disabled People, | 1079.32
as I told in my earlier reply, is running | 1080.84
skill development programs | 1083.679
across the country in collaboration with MSMEs. | 1086.96
In India, such skill development activities are being | 1089.12
taken forward and a large | 1091.32
number of persons with disabilities are coming forward to get trained in it. The statistics that | 1096.0
came recently have shown that almost all the qualified persons with disabilities have been employed with private companies. | 1106.44
Demand was in the number of 10000 and out of that, I am | 1108.919
happy to tell you that | 1111.84
in this skill development and employment bridge, employment | 1114.559
bridge has been constructed by the Department of Disability Empowerment, | 1116.88
which aims to create a | 1119.4
bridge between the employers and the users.  Out of | 1121.559
approximately 10,000 jobs, | 1126.24
only 827 suggestions are left in this direction, which | 1129.039
means that with full awareness about this, the | 1131.76
Department of Disability Empowerment is | 1134.159
working to take forward its responsibilities. | 1136.08
Honorable members, there is a very long list | 1139.2
of supplementary topics.  This is also very serious. | 1142.679
I will try to have | 1146.12
a brief discussion on this topic in the next session. | 
###
1150.08
Mrs. Supriya | 1152.12
Sule Sir, I had only a small question that the | 1155.12
Minister brought a very good scheme and the | 1157.4
UD ID card also brought the whole scheme, | 1160.32
you alone. | 1162.12
Sir, you have taken us to Pune district, we are the | 1165.6
toppers in the country for the scheme. My | 1167.64
only request to Sir is that all the goods have | 1170.72
not arrived yet because there is no budget, so | 1173.159
all the people from here who have got there on merit, | 1176.36
then the scheme.  Considering that we are the toppers in the country, it is not being | 1178.24
implemented in Pune district in Maharashtra. This should be | 1182.32
thought about in this budget. So, | 1184.32
my request is thank you sir.  | 
###
1187.12
Honorable Minister has given a suggestion by the honorable member | 1190.0
and in this regard, when the budget is presented.  If this is done, then | 1193.64
all these things are put | 1196.96
before the Finance Ministry by all the departments | 1198.96
and we are continuously | 1202.72
trying to ensure that wherever the proposals come from across the country for the | 1208.28
needs of assistive devices for the disabled people, | 1211.72
they are all  There was no shortage of efforts by us to complete it on the basis of budgetary availability. |

1219.08
202 Satish Kumar | 1223.24
Gautam Honorable Minister, | 1225.88
Honorable Member, I | 1232.24
would like to ask the Honorable Home Minister, | 1238.72
what has been the impact of the efforts being made to deal with leftist extremism. | 
###
1244.84
Good effect of the efforts. | 1250.76
Leftist | 1253.32
extremists have become a threat to the internal security of this country. | 1259.919
Sir, leftist extremists neither have | 1264.039
faith in the Constitution of India nor in the democracy of India. They do | 1272.919
not even have any faith in the founding principles of the Indian nation. They resort to violence | 1277.279
through violence.  They want to grab power from India, | 1281.48
they do not believe in people's democracy and | 1289.4
all the | 1290.48
organizations with this ideology always attack the basic spirit of India. | 1295.12
These leftist extremists have | 1299.72
killed thousands of innocent people. | 1303.24
You | 1304.96
tell me, there is still a dearth of women. | 1309.64
And there are children. Sir, | 1317.08
I want to tell this country and this House through a comparative figure about the impact that it has had. | 1321.559
Sir, the incidents of LWE violence that took place from May 2004 to | 1328.08
April 2014 were | 1332.6
1627, which from May 2014  The incidents that have taken place till April 2024 are | 1344.72
7696 in which there is a decrease of 53 | 1350.64
Q. Sir, it is true that the security forces | 1355.039
who lost their lives were those of the | 1360.96
previous government, | 1365.48
from 2004 to 14, in which | 1369.48
1824 soldiers lost their lives.  Lives were lost and | 1374.08
in these 10 years of Modi's NDA government, our | 1379.88
own soldiers have | 1382.159
also lost their lives and when seen in this way, there has been a | 1386.159
decrease of 72% in the number of | 1389.799
civilians who have lost their lives | 1393.679
in the last 10 years i.e. | 1400.36
4744 civilians have lost their lives between 14th May | 1406.36
2014 and 1481 civilians have lost their lives between 24th May 2014. | 1410.12
This is also not good | 1414.44
but there has been a | 1417.32
reduction in the number of civilians losing their lives who are | 1421.679
killed by Left Wing Extremists. | 1426.32
This has reduced by 69%.  If we look at the number of | 1432.159
civilians and security forces including soldiers who lost their lives in LWE violence, | 1439.2
then | 1440.6
6568 soldiers and civilians were killed, | 1444.24
which came down to 1990 between 2014 and 24, a | 1448.48
decrease of 70%. | 1452.36
Sir, in this way a  According to the figures, the | 1462.2
number of civilians who lost their lives and the number of martyred security personnel has decreased by 86 percent compared to the number of martyred security personnel in 2010. There has been a | 1469.36
decrease of 86 percent and the | 1473.32
incidents of violence have decreased by 73 percent. If | 1479.039
seen from the geographical point of view, earlier it was | 1483.159
126 i.e. | 1486.12
Till 2013, there were 126 districts in 2013, which has now | 1493.0
reduced to 38 districts in 20224. There | 1499.919
were 96 districts in 2010, which has reduced to 42 districts in 2023. | 1505.2
In 2010, 465 police stations were under the | 1510.64
influence of LW, which will reduce to 100 police stations in 2023. | 1515.24
I am left and sir, | 1518.36
if I talk about 2024, in just 6 months of 2024, | 1523.279
166 leftist militants have been | 1528.36
killed, | 1530.0
which is a record. | 1532.88
In these six months, more than 600 leftist | 1539.44
militants have surrendered. Sir, | 1542.88
this is  It shows that the efforts that have been made under the guidance of the Honorable Home Minister under his determination and inspiration in the last 10 | 1546.2
years under the leadership of the NDA government of Narendra Modi are | 1560.96
clearly visible and | 1564.08
in the coming days, leftist extremists will be eliminated from India. | 1571.64
Will be abolished, |

Barod Awad like ask question related to | 1830.399
this particular topic The House is aware of | 1834.159
India Northeast is surrounded | 1837.96

contain the | 1872.24

###
1876.24
such a question related to this question | 1879.0
No, there is no leftist extremism, but | 1882.399
as much work has been done in the areas of North East, | 1884.48
Ganji, if you give me | 1888.88
some information then I will tell you the details. | 1892.44
According to the areas of leftist extremism, there is more than | 1900.12
60% violence in the North East also under all the heads of violence.  The shortage has | 1905.399
occurred all over the North East but does | 1908.399
not appear in today's question. | 1910.799
Honorable member is requested to | 1913.0
give a separate notice. |

2030.919
Mr. Sogata Roy. | 2034.679
No, | 2038.32
today the question should not be asked sitting but | 2040.96
standing, | 2042.84
thank you very much | 2047.839
Sir, this | 2051.919
problem of leftist extremists is happening in three-four provinces in the last 10-15 years. | 2057.879
Most of all, | 2060.48
Chhattisgarh, followed by Gadchiroli in Maharashtra, then | 2064.48
Andhra, Kora in Orissa | 2068.839
and then Andhra Pradesh.  Somehow, even | 2074.119
every week I see that the encounter | 2077.599
with the security forces did | 2081.679
not stop the Maoists, but I | 2085.52
want to bring to your notice that | 2089.28
leftist extremism also took place in West Bengal, but | 2092.879
Mamata Banerjee's government is doing development there. | 2101.64
Listen, | 2106.16
what is the question after that, your sir, the | 2109.68
question is that only one farmer | 2114.44
had to accept it and just now | 2118.599
leftist extremism has stopped in West Bengal. I am the | 2122.96
Honorable National Minister.  I | 2126.16
want to ask the Home Minister whether | 2129.16
he will study the example of West Bengal and apply the same model of | 2133.56
Chhattisgarh in other places | 2136.32
because these people are not able to control, | 
###
2141.44
sir, any state should do well | 2148.96
in implementing its example in the entire country.  Narendra Modi government has no problem | 2152.0
but not me. I believe that | 2156.24
no state in the country would want the | 2158.2
model of West Bengal to be adopted there. | 
###
2163.64
Question No. 23 Shri Virendra | 2173.52
Singh has been laid on the table, | 2185.079
Honorable Honorable Minister Gan Junior | 2189.119
Back Honorable | 2191.8
Member.  Sir, my | 2194.72
direct question was to the Honorable Minister | 2198.0
that how will the farmers get the crop insurance scheme | 2203.079
in an easy way, | 2204.8
but | 2207.599
I am not able to understand the answer given by the Honorable Minister, | 2211.72
then what will the farmers of the country understand | 2215.28
and it seems that  Your question is, I am saying, | 2218.16
Sir, I am placing my pain in front of you. You are | 2221.0
my patron. First of all, I | 2225.119
want to ask the Honorable Minister that | 2232.92
why is he not given the benefit of crop insurance when the crops standing in the fields catch fire?  Why do | 2239.56
n't the farmers get the benefit of what is covered and at the same time, the | 2247.96
farmer who does share farming suffers huge | 2251.56
loss and the government does not take it into cognizance.  I | 2254.599
want to ask | 2257.599
whether the standing crop which is | 2260.92
around thousands of acres of crop in our area Chandauli gets burnt | 2264.92
then we will get benefit from it and the sharecroppers who are | 2270.119
our farmers will also get benefit from it | 2273.52
or not? I want a straight answer, | 
###
2276.079
Sir, | 2279.839
Honorable Speaker. | 2282.599
I respect the honorable member, | 2286.359
but if he did not understand even such an answer, | 2289.839
then I wonder how I should | 2292.72
answer, | 2294.56
but the farmer is intelligent | 2297.56
and I am giving his example. Honorable | 2300.88
Speaker, I will also answer his question, | 2306.44
but the earlier crop insurance schemes | 2310.359
were  There were many types of difficulties in them, | 2313.52
many crop insurance schemes were also brought by the government there, | 2316.839
today there are many questions | 2319.839
on this, Honorable Speaker Sir, not only the honorable members, | 2323.319
farmers also | 2325.319
want to know about many crop insurance | 2327.96
schemes, I will not take their names but there | 2332.44
were high premiums for the farmers.  The one who could not pay, there were insufficient claims, | 2337.72
the amount received was less, there | 2342.88
was delay in settlement of claims, | 2344.4
Honorable Speaker Sir, the farmers and farmer | 2347.56
organizations had many types of objections. I am | 2352.16
proud to say that Prime Minister Narendra | 2354.64
Modi ji took the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana | 2359.04
and only I. | 2361.4
I would like to tell you this much, Honorable Speaker | 2363.839
Sir, ever since this crop insurance scheme came, please | 2366.8
compare, | 2368.4
earlier only | 2372.24
3 crore 51 | 2375.04
lakh applications were received, but now 8 crore 69 lakh applications have been received | 2380.359
because there is trust in the farmers that | 2382.319
non-loaney, non- | 2384.92
loanee farmers, earlier, the farmers were  It is understood that | 2387.88
only 20 lakh applications were received when their | 2391.359
government was in power, now 5 crore 48 lakh | 2397.52
farmer | 2399.119
applications have come, when that government was there, 3 crore 71 lakh applications have come, | 2403.24
now 14 crore 14 crore 17 | 2407.4
lakh have come and the total disbursed amount has increased.  2 | 2411.24
crore | 2413.599
7195 crore and I want to say one more thing, | 2417.68
I am coming to your point, | 2420.44
please Honorable | 2425.8
Speaker Sir, it is not a story, it is the truth, | 2430.2
premium of Rs 3440 crore has been | 2433.079
paid by the farmers and Rs 1 | 2436.2
crore | 2438.079
164000 crore has been given to them as claim. | 2441.88
Through this crop insurance scheme, as | 2446.56
far as the Honorable Speaker | 2451.28
Sir Bhanj is also concerned, brother, I am an | 2454.319
uncle, I | 2458.119
want to give you information, Honorable | 2461.68
Member, | 2463.8
if the crop gets damaged due to natural reasons, then | 2468.52
it is completely covered and the farmer | 2471.56
gets its benefit.  And the coverage of sharecroppers | 2475.2
is also on the basis of certificate from the state government, | 2479.119
so don't worry, if the state government | 2482.319
certifies then we also | 2485.88
cover the sharecroppers and include them in this scheme. | 
###
2491.72
I want to tell you that our | 2495.72
area Chandauli  In the Lok Sabha, there was a | 2500.119
fire in thousands of acres and they did not get the benefit of crop insurance | 2503.8
and in order to mislead them, have you people tried to | 2512.16
lure them by giving them small amounts of money from the Mandi Committee, | 2515.2
which is very sad, let me tell you.  I just | 2517.8
want to ask, it doesn't come in fire, so tell me, I have | 2520.52
requested earlier, I have | 2523.8
come straight and told all the natural | 2527.96
causes, | 2529.64
in which all the | 2532.88
natural causes are covered under | 2535.68
natural causes. Honorable Chairman, Sir, if | 2538.319
fire occurs due to natural causes, then it will be fire.  Bhi covert hai usam kya |

that there are thousands of farmers  In | 2579.92
Nandurbar District which live in a | 2582.64
forest area and mountain area mountain | 2585.559
region they have not been able to get the benefit | 2587.92
of PM Fasal Bima Yojana because the photo has to be | 2591.2
uploaded within 48 hours and | 2593.8
unfortunately there are some network | 2595.68
problems there are internet problems.  So | 2598.0
there for the photo is not uploaded sir how do | 2600.0
you want to tackle this issue sir because of a very | 2602.48
big issue not just for this scheme for any | 2604.92

connect to internet so internet facility is not there | 2610.92
yes the problem  Always Pending Sir, so | 2614.119
how is this | 2617.96
practical,  | 
###
2620.839
Honorable Speaker Sir, as I said, we have | 2623.839
created a portal in the name of DG Claim. If farmers complain for some | 2628.76
reason that they are not getting the benefits, | 2631.359
then there | 2634.559
is a system for effective monitoring of the complaint.  If there is | 2637.64
any problem of net then we will try to solve it also | 2642.39
[appreciation] | 
###
2648.92
I | 2652.2
want to know from the Honorable Minister through you that | 2660.76
how many applications have been received under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana since 2016 till now and | 2664.88
how many of them were loan farmers.  How many insured farmers | 2669.64
were there and what was the gross insured amount? No, | 2673.8
Honorable Member, nowadays a House | 2678.88
should be aware that | 2680.76
it | 2683.72
depends on the farmer voluntarily to get the insurance done. If the | 2686.559
farmer wants, he can get the insurance done or | 2689.559
not, I go to this information many times. | 
###
2698.559
Honorable | 2702.319
Chairman, I would like to request through you, please | 2705.359
tell me the details of | 2707.52
crop insurance. When there was the old crop insurance scheme, the one who | 2712.599
was a debtor of the bank at that time could get | 2717.48
his insurance.  It was done as necessary | 2720.839
and the | 2724.119
bank automatically deducted the amount of insurance premium. The | 2725.96
government removed this discrepancy and | 2730.119
made this scheme voluntary. If you | 2732.52
wish, then get insured and if you | 2737.359
do not wish, do not get insured. This was done forcefully.  It is | 2739.64
not at all in the scheme, | 2742.0
earlier the farmer did not get insurance | 2747.8
but now if he wants he can also get insurance | 2753.319
and the honorable member was asking | 2758.119
how much area has been covered till date, I want to tell him | 2761.119
that the area covered till now is | 2766.16
That | 2768.2
51000 hectares has been covered, it will increase to | 2773.96
58 thousand hectares in 2023 and 3 crore | 2778.079
97 lakh farmers have been covered. Farmers are continuously working to adopt this crop insurance | 2782.559
scheme and the | 2786.92
government has taken many measures to simplify it, | 2791.4
Honorable Speaker Sir.  Due to which the | 2794.24
farmer should not face any problem and trouble in availing the benefits of the scheme. | 
###
2798.119
Mr. Kaushalendra | 2803.96
Kumar, I congratulate and thank you for asking the supplementary question. | 2806.96
I | 2810.839
want to know from the Honorable Minister. Prime Minister Crop Insurance is | 2817.44
considered a beneficial scheme for the farmers in the country.  There is also compensation for crop loss, | 2821.28
but in our state Bihar, the | 2825.0
premium of farmer crop insurance is | 2829.119
three times more than other states. I | 2832.24
want to know from the Honorable Minister that the premium in crop insurance Bihar should be | 2835.319
made rational. | 2839.0
Thank you, Honorable Chairman, | 
###
2841.839
Crop Insurance.  There are | 2847.2
three different models of crop insurance | 2849.319
and in that model, the state government, the central | 2852.48
government only makes the policy, the state | 2856.68
government chooses the model it wants to choose | 2860.76
and as I want to tell you through this, | 2868.68
after choosing the model, the insurance | 2870.839
companies.  At a competitive rate because many | 2873.72
insurance companies work to | 2875.4
implement the crop insurance scheme of private sector as well as public sector | 2879.359
and this crop insurance scheme is | 2882.48
not necessary for every state, which state | 2886.44
wants to adopt it, which state does not | 2889.319
want to adopt it, Bihar has not adopted it.  Till now, the | 2892.24
scheme of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima | 2895.76
Yojana has | 2898.079
not been implemented by Bihar, the | 2900.92
state has its own scheme, so they | 2903.76
benefit their farmers according to that scheme, |

Bima | 2919.92
Yojana and | 2921.72
Session on 10 August 2021 has highlighted several key | 2926.96
issues and including one of the important thing it mentions is the | 2930.16
delay in | 2933.28
settlement of the insurance claims by the | 2936.799
farmers and whereas it  Is a very | 2939.839
complicated process also to get the | 2942.839
claim and for example my | 2947.28
constitution | 2950.16
2023 we have had unprecedented floods | 2954.319
and many of the farmers have insured their | 2958.319
crops but even after several months we have | 2961.72
not got the claim or the money they have to | 2966.2
get from.  The Insurance and they are still | 2968.64
waiting and in your reply the Minister has said that they do | 2972.079
not plan to give any proposal | 2976.0
for constitution | 2978.48
of the rules on crop insurance will the | 2983.44
Minister consider that because it is quite | 2986.2
complicated because it has to be | 2989.16
district wise unless it  The crop failure i | 2993.4
district wise some times they do not give | 2995.48
insurance is very complicated so to | 2998.24
simplify it further will they | 3001.44
consider yno continue a committee and also i | 3005.64
like the minister to reply about tutu | 3009.359
kudi farmers also thank you sir | 
###
3012.24
read honorable president | 3015.079
sir scheme complete  There is a | 3018.28
unit of the scheme for every farmer in every district of the country. Earlier there used to be | 3022.88
discrepancies. The block was made a unit. | 3026.92
Now Gram Panchayat has been made a unit | 3030.76
so that if there is any loss to the farmer in the Gram Panchayat, then | 3032.96
that farmer's loss can be | 3036.04
compensated properly. | 3042.079
We worked to remove the shortcomings in the earlier schemes and along with this, it has been made | 3052.079
necessary that at least four crop cutting experiments will be conducted in every Gram Panchayat. Again, we have | 3055.52
made another innovation under the guidance of the Prime Minister. | 3057.72
Now it has been made mandatory to assess the loss not visually but at least | 3063.04
30% through remote sensing, | 3069.96
so that if the revenue staff does it then there is a | 3073.559
possibility of going wrong at times. It is | 3076.319
true that many a times there is delay in payment of claims.  There | 3080.16
would have been a delay, but we saw all the reasons in those cases. Till now, the | 3083.48
system that is in place, Honorable | 3086.799
Chairman, the claim is calculated within a month of receiving the yield data from the state government. | 3093.44
Look, we make a policy and it is | 3099.76
also the responsibility of the state government to implement it properly.  This is the work of the state government and | 3103.28
if there is a delay in the payment of that claim, then now I | 3111.359
would like to tell the honorable member that in one provision, we have made that | 3114.24
if the insurance company delays, | 3117.24
then a penalty of Rs 12 will be imposed on it, which will be directly credited to the | 3122.119
farmer's account. | 3125.04
But due to delay, if we go, | 3129.64
most of them are | 3131.52
at 99.98. The reason is | 3135.0
late release of their share in premium subsidy by the states. | 3137.76
Honorable Speaker Sir, I would like to | 3140.559
request the state governments through you to | 3143.4
also request the state government of Tamil Nadu. | 3145.88
I would like that he should | 3152.119
not delay in releasing his share in the premium subsidy. More than 90% of the time, there is a | 3155.839
delay because sometimes the yield figures are | 3159.28
obtained from the bill. In some cases, there is a | 3161.839
dispute between the insurance company and the state. | 3164.559
Sometimes some numbers of farmers get wrong, | 3167.799
due to which there is some delay, | 3170.88
but earlier there was another arrangement, | 3175.48
when the state government used to give its amount, only then the central | 3178.52
government used to give its share. We have | 3181.52
made one more provision that we have used the state's | 3184.96
share to pay our share.  Dealing has been done with you and the | 3187.68
Central Government will release its share immediately | 3190.359
so that there is no delay in the payment of the farmer. He should definitely get the | 3193.04
share which is due to the Central Government | 3195.559
and then I assure the Honorable Member | 3198.52
that if there is delay in receiving the claim.  If the | 3202.52
farmer will be late, then the work will be done by | 3205.319
imposing a penalty on Rs. 12 from this Kharif crop and | 3209.079
depositing it directly into the farmer's account. | 3211.839
As far as forming a committee regarding the scheme is | 3213.96
concerned, today I do not feel the need. | 3217.839
If the honorable member would | 3220.2
like to give any suggestion.  He is welcome | 
###
3223.92
Harendra Malik ji, why did you get up so suddenly when you called me, you were the | 3229.079
first to get up, | 3231.48
thank you very much, Manwar, I | 3236.799
want to know through the Honorable Minister, that the Honorable Minister has just said | 3239.04
in this respected House that this  The insurance scheme | 3241.64
is voluntary, my definite information is that | 3244.599
today every farmer's loan is closed, everyone has KCC | 3247.96
and the bank which does KCC immediately | 3251.4
insures the crop. Number one, number two is the | 3254.64
claim you give, which is the cost price. | 3257.88
What about the farmer's crop?  Is there an equivalent to it or not? | 
###
3260.68
Honorable Minister, Honorable Speaker, the | 3263.839
claim is given as per the loss. | 3266.68
What is the question of equivalent? The | 3269.28
claim is paid on the basis of the loss. | 3271.48
Deduction of ACC. Please also tell that this | 3274.599
was earlier in this scheme and not now.  It is | 3277.88
up to the farmer whether he wants to get the insurance done or not, | 3281.359
no claim can be deducted by force, | 3284.24
one minute, one minute, one minute, please do | 3288.76
not debate for a minute, please sit, honorable member, | 3292.319
please do not debate, the honorable minister | 3296.119
also | 3296.88
gave such information.  Had also given information, | 3299.04
wanted clarification for my information, | 3301.0
now when clarification is done from both the sides, do | 3303.76
not keep any doubt in your mind, if someone | 3306.359
cuts forcefully, then the farmer should give it to him in writing, it will | 3309.52
not be cut, the farmer does not give it in writing, | 3311.559
hence it is cut.   | 
###
3315.68
Question No. 204 Dilip Seya Ji, now there is a very long debate on this, you can give a | 3319.599
separate notice, you will make arrangements sometime. | 3327.599
Honorable Speaker Sir, details on this subject have been placed on the table of the House. | 3331.4
Speaker | 3333.72
Sir, the incredible contribution of the cooperative sector in the economic development of the country. | 3345.28
This came to light when the Ministry of Cooperation was created on 6 July 2021 under the | 3348.599
leadership of Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi | 3354.92
and the | 3358.559
responsibility of this department went to the | 3362.16
Honorable Home Minister and Cooperation Minister Shri | 3365.359
Amit Shah, who has been the source of inspiration for all of us for the last three years.  In the | 3368.799
economic development of the country, | 3370.96
Primary Agricultural Credit Societies, which are Primary | 3375.799
Agricultural Credit | 3378.28
Societies, have been opened in large numbers across the country. | 3381.0
My question is how much more can be done to connect | 3387.52
every sector from agriculture to every sector in the country in the coming times.  The | 3393.799
scheme of opening primary committees and states is of the Ministry of Government of India. | 
###
3400.839
Chairman, Sir, the honorable member has just | 3406.92
said that to fulfill the resolve of our honorable Prime Minister for a | 3410.64
developed India, | 3414.319
an independent ministry has been | 3417.079
formed and since then, the | 3420.64
honorable member of the country has  Under the leadership of Cooperative Minister Respected | 3423.4
Amit Bhai Shah Ji, | 3434.44
many initiatives have been started to make this cooperative sector more powerful. A | 3439.92
total of 54 | 3441.96
initiatives have been created by this Cooperative Ministry | 3448.24
through its PACS which has | 3451.839
just been published here.  Mentioned about PACS, | 3454.76
PACS is more important in this, we are a | 3458.119
part of it and through it the | 3462.68
rural people are getting connected to a large extent. In | 3466.559
many states like Maharashtra, | 3469.559
Gujarat, more than 50 percent of the population is | 3474.039
connected to cooperatives. | 3477.16
And that is why | 3478.24
till now | 3485.119
about 105000 PACS have been formed in the entire country | 3489.319
and their work should be done well, it should | 3493.599
work easily, | 3495.319
be it a district bank or a state bank, | 3502.799
it is better that they | 3506.319
coordinate with the people, the farmers and the | 3510.0
PACS should also work.  To make it easier, | 3514.24
we have made a plan so far to computerize the PACS. | 3522.16
We have made a plan to computerize the PACS and so far the proposal for computerization of 6930 PACS has been approved in a total of 30 | 3526.28
states and union territories, out of which | 3540.52
hardware is purchased by the Central Government. | 3546.119
So far, a total amount of Rs 654 crore has been released for setting up support system, be it digitization | 3552.4
and by NABARD, State Government, | 3556.319
NAB and Central Government, | 3559.28
for the work of computerization, an | 3567.16
amount of Rs. 60 crore has been released by the Central Government.  It is given by 30 state governments and | 3570.2
10 are given by NABARD. Till now | 3574.72
till 18th July 2024, 568 PACS have been | 3580.48
implemented on RP software. A | 3583.4
total of 583 PACS have been approved and | 3588.119
further by strengthening these PACS,  Through this, I have | 3596.28
resolved to strengthen the rural economy. Through this, | 3599.52
I want to inform the House | 3602.2
that going forward, | 3605.2
this is our proposal in every region, in every state. |
