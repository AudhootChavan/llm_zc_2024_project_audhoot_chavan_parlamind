Basant Sir Question | 26.92
No. Honorable Minister Sir | 32.32
Rebel | 36.879
Member Sir My question to the Minister is how does the | 39.96
Ministry coordinate with State | 41.76
Governments to answer the supply of water? | 43.92
Through the scheme there are only portions of | 46.199
villages and houses that are connected with | 48.0
taps but still not receiving water which measures have been made | 51.16
to implement to ensure that | 53.399
all our holes and particular in under | 55.6
served areas receive a consistent and | 57.84
reliable water connection in 2024 Additional  What | 61.28
strategies are in place to manage water | 63.199
crisis during national disaster? |
###
69.88
Honorable Speaker has | 
76.24
asked the member a lot in his question and has | 80.52
given a written answer to it, but those who are still | 84.28
talking about water supply, then water supply. | 87.96
This is the work of the state government. | 90.72
They are given financial help | 93.84
and technical assistance by the ministry. | 97.799
They are also given technical assistance for bar management. An | 100.28
SOP has been prepared which has been shared with all the states. | 106.119
In times of floods, your SOP and | 109.32
our SOP should also be used for | 112.399
more effective work and | 114.92
work should be done to ensure that there is no damage to the fence. | 
###
125.399
The Jalshakti website is facing difficulties in | 127.56
accessing the block level reports. There are | 130.039
concerns about the reliability and | 131.92
accuracy of the report. | 134.64
However, there are no measures taken to address the issue. | 137.8
Thank you sir, | 
###
143.44
the information we provide here is | 147.64
received from all the states. | 150.2
On the basis of all the information coming from the states, the | 153.239
Ministry presents its report and | 155.28
presents its views. | 
###
156.4
Mrs. | 158.8
D. Puran Devi, | 
161.879
Mr. Thank you, Speaker Sir, India is home | 165.879
to 7.6 per cent of the world's population and but | 169.8
fresh water resources.  Just around | 172.239
4 per and in Water Quality Index India | 176.28
Ranks 120 out of 122 countries Mini | 180.12
himself in his reply has mentioned about the | 182.36
deplete water resources in a country so | 186.319
my question to the noble minister user would | 189.599
be after there has been a study as to even  With | 192.959
urbanization increasing at a very rapid | 195.28
pace they have been studying how many liters | 199.36
of water per person is required and giving | 202.56
in to the fact there are deplete water | 204.72
resources and limited water available in | 207.44
India right now which should be the focus action | 210.799
towards  Improving Water Supply to | 217.04
Household: | 
###
219.799
Honorable Speaker, in the question that has been asked, | 223.36
he has asked for many details. I | 226.599
would like to correct them that out of the total population of the whole world, | 229.599
our country has 18% of the population | 232.319
and the number of livestock in the whole world is the highest. | 235.72
Livestock is present here at 18. | 238.72
He said that | 242.92
what he told about the water in the whole world is fine on figure 04 | 246.319
but how much water is there in every village, | 249.76
what is ground water, what is the condition of surface water, the | 251.799
entire exercise was | 255.079
done by the Ministry.  I have gone to about 8000 villages and | 261.6
also practiced the availability of water in all the states and | 263.96
shared it with all the states. | 266.759
In the coming days, the way the | 270.16
states are working, it is a matter of respect to everyone.  The | 279.12
practice done for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan of providing tap water to every house will be very beneficial | 281.88
and everyone will get full water. Whatever | 284.08
complaints there may be, they will go | 286.84
away due to the same practice.  |
###
289.98
Mr. EB Dunn | 
291.479
Yes | 293.639
Har Ghar Jal The objective of bringing water under Jal Jeevan Mission | 298.039
is to ensure that people do not get polluted water. | 302.32
Na Sir Sir Har Ghar Jal is a very good initiative | 307.919
of the Government of India through connection | 311.4
household.  Connections have been provided to many | 314.12
different Panchayats across the country | 317.4
but the biggest challenge in this program is | 319.84
the sources of water is very less the | 324.6
existing sources have been | 326.72
depleted once you give new connections there are | 329.759
no sufficient sources so once you give | 333.039
water connections you  The tap delivers | 337.12
air, not water. The problem | 339.96
is this is a very serious issue. If the | 342.919
government decides to improve the sources, | 345.919
this project can be implemented in much | 348.8
different creative manner. The government | 351.8
tries to do any initiative to improve the | 354.72
Sources and to lay new pipelines to the | 358.039
existing projects | 362.12
Honorable Speaker, you mentioned potted water | 365.36
in the middle, I | 367.84
would like to tell you that there should be a chemical test for the water given in every village | 375.08
and on the basis of the test, I have made potted water.  | 379.599
Did  not talk about water, I said that the | 383.12
benefit of Jal Jeevan Mission Har Gal Yojana is that | 386.72
instead of the polluted water which was earlier available, people are | 389.28
getting water from every gal. The benefit of the scheme is that they are | 392.8
getting pure water. | 
### 
395.319
Respected  Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji said.  That | 399.199
water was not available in the last 70 years, | 407.039
why the Honorable Minister, | 409.56
Respected Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji, | 412.639
that people were | 416.599
not getting pure water for so many years, women were not getting it in their homes, | 420.56
about 1.5 crore hours a day for their water. | 424.56
Used to be sold, they had to go for many kilometers | 427.039
and even there they got potted water. | 430.08
Today everyone has | 434.84
started getting pure water because of tap water in every house. Because of Modi ji's | 437.759
scheme, we are providing financial assistance to them in every state under it.  The | 445.44
DPR is prepared by the State Government, | 447.479
its tendering is also done by the State Government, | 453.039
our share of technical assistance and financial assistance is | 456.96
done by the Ministry and | 459.0
monitoring is also done on it, which is | 462.52
what the member said.  It was said that at many places water is not available, only | 466.199
air comes. There are many such incidents and | 469.56
on top of that, we inform them to the state government. | 471.72
We have also made a tax. If | 474.919
any such question arises, then we | 476.919
bring the solution to it immediately and that too.  This scheme is | 480.52
being successful, so about 15 crore connections have been | 484.56
given under this scheme in this country. | 
###
490.96
Murai Lal Meena | 494.0
ji,  | 496.72
I would like to know from the Minister through you that | 499.199
Rajasthan has the most dire situation in terms of drinking water. | 501.4
And under JGM, | 503.599
45 paisa belongs to the Central Government, 45 paisa | 506.479
belongs to the State Government and 10 paisa is | 508.84
accepted from public contribution. I | 511.0
request through you that in Rajasthan, are the | 512.599
villages situated very far away and | 514.56
also the groundwater?  Firstly, the | 517.0
public is not giving 10% contribution and | 518.959
secondly, the | 522.44
electricity bills under all the schemes under JGM, | 525.12
I understand that the | 527.64
connections were cut at around 80% because the | 529.72
electricity bills were accumulated.  No, first of all there | 532.399
was no supply because | 534.32
people did not contribute and even if contribution is given then | 536.6
some decision should be taken in the electricity bills | 538.48
so that the electricity bill can be deposited and | 541.36
water supply can be done smoothly. This is a | 543.24
big problem in the entire state. | 
###
546.48
Memar's question is appropriate. | 550.0
Rajasthan's situation has already been weak in water. The | 556.92
work that should have been done under the Jal Jeevan Mission has not | 560.079
been done there, but now the Chief Minister of that place has | 563.16
met the Ministry about three times.  In order | 565.36
to immediately implement this scheme, whether the | 568.399
water source is | 570.2
ground water or surface water, the | 575.72
Ministry is making efforts to ensure that water is available through new canals. The Ministry is providing technical | 577.839
and financial assistance to those who do | 581.56
not want to pay electricity bills.  Due to which the connection gets cut | 584.36
and water is not available, the | 587.04
ministry has also asked everyone to install solar because of | 590.279
which there will be no need to pay the bills | 592.6
and the money that has to be taken from the village, | 595.56
money has to be taken from the people, that is in the scheme itself. | 598.0
Raj's work has to be taken from there |

always keep their attention should not be raised while talking to each other. | 777.76
Question Number One | 779.639
Mrs. Amat Kor Badal Question Number 14 Sir | 782.639
Honorable Minister, the answer was | 784.16
laid on the table.  | 
###
788.279
Thank you Sir. In the reply of the Honorable Minister, it is | 791.16
written that  The Government of Punjab has | 793.6
told them that nothing is happening in Punjab regarding no last minute | 797.24
repair scheme and there is | 800.279
no rainfall in Punjab every year. Last | 803.72
year there was heavy rainfall in 2023 and there was rainfall | 807.959
in 2019. I am so surprised. | 811.44
That the Punjab government does not know what is | 813.88
happening in Punjab. Last year there were | 816.36
floods in Punjab twice and 21 out of 23 | 820.199
districts were flooded. Thousands of acres and two lakh | 823.12
hectares of crops were destroyed. More than 10,000 | 826.16
houses were destroyed. More than 60,000  More animals | 829.68
died. What is your question? So sir, my | 831.639
question is, did City Star not | 835.12
know but did the central government also not know | 837.959
that such a huge flood has happened in Punjab | 840.56
and so much devastation has happened in Punjab? | 843.199
They | 846.72
gave very good compensation everywhere in Himachal and Uttarakhand, | 850.04
but did they not know that in | 852.199
21 out of 23 Punjab, there was severe flood and | 854.279
severe damage to the infrastructure, so why was | 857.079
no relief rehabilitation | 859.92
given to them?  | 
###
862.68
Ask this question in this budget for a minute.  You senior members were ministers, you asked, | 865.44
Punjab Government, you asked, this belonged to the | 868.639
Punjab Government, this belonged to the State, the | 871.04
Minister should not make a bonfire of a state | 873.0
subject, I also request the honorable ministers | 876.0
that no bonfire of a state subject should be done here. | 880.32
Let's answer. Honorable Speaker, | 
###
884.519
we had sent the member's question to the Punjab Government. On the | 886.959
basis of his answer, we have | 890.199
given him a written reply.  | 
###
893.16
It is being broadcast everywhere in the channel that Punjab has become so | 896.199
flooded and the government here.  I don't know, | 898.079
anyway, my second question | 900.8
to the Minister is that there is a lot of corruption in the name of cleaning of drainage | 904.0
because the cleaning is | 905.8
done only on paper and it is | 907.519
not done in the drains, so can | 910.12
this cleaning be done through satellite technology or any other method?  There is no physical | 913.519
verification or by forming a committee with the Panchayats, | 916.0
my second addition is that every | 918.839
year the river of Ghaghar in my constituency hits very | 921.959
hard there. Every year the | 924.92
water overflows there and floods | 929.199
our Ghaggar which is from Chandpura.  The bandh that is broken is | 931.759
in the land of Haryana, that much land was | 934.92
taken by the Punjab government, but when the | 938.04
time of overflow comes, the Haryana government | 940.279
imposed 164 and no more than four people can gather there, the | 943.319
people of Punjab | 945.319
cannot go and strengthen the bandh.  Can do and the land of Punjab | 948.04
which is low and that of Haryana is high, | 950.56
breaks the dam and floods Punjab, so | 953.639
where such things happen every year, is it the | 956.8
money given by the central government and is there any monitoring along with it?  Is there | 963.519
any accountability for the strength of the flow of money | 967.519
that corruption happens every year, floods | 971.04
happen, a lot of money is spent, | 973.959
officers etc. make money, there is no speech in it, | 977.48
Honorable Minister,  | 
###
981.44
Honorable Speaker, the question that | 983.199
was asked by the member.  Cleaning of drains etc. is a question of the state government | 986.68
and it is the responsibility of the state government, | 989.399
we do not have any monitoring on it | 992.319
and whatever he has just talked about on the embankment of Jo Bagh of Dhaggar river, | 995.8
then the | 998.519
Dhaggar Standing Committee has started working on this river. | 1001.319
The matter is | 1004.6
sub-judice and | 1008.56
states also have different views on the modeling study. There is | 1013.92
also a need to prepare DPR as per the modeling study done by CW CPR, | 1017.0
which is the job of the state government. |

1122.0
HON'BLE MINISTER The | 1125.12
question has been asked by the HON'BLE SPEAKER HON'BLE MEMBER | 1128.559
because the HON'BLE MEMBER has asked about | 1131.799
his concern.  The question has been asked | 1135.12
in your area within the Barpeta area, | 1138.24
five | 1140.2
projects worth Rs 14004 crore have been completed, | 1142.919
which is 98 kilometers, | 1146.039
work is going on in seven projects, which is 71 kilometers, which | 1150.6
is 4204 kilometers. A specific question has been | 1153.52
asked by you.  Which is related to Paplu Garh Jorhat | 1157.88
which is of 194 kilometers and is a | 1162.12
scheme of Rs. 6100 crores. The | 1165.64
scheme which you are mentioning is of about 112 kilometers | 1167.919
and in that scheme you have told | 1170.4
that there is shortage in the work. | 1174.2
By the contractor because and in this | 1176.96
you have also told about the delay and in this I | 1179.2
want to tell you in advance that | 1181.12
due to the delay, when the | 1184.08
land is related to the tribunal along with the process of selection of a road, it | 1186.28
also takes some time to get the statutory approval. | 1189.76
And there is a problem in adding useful facilities | 1192.48
and | 1195.76
all the arrangements have to be made by the contractor also. | 1197.4
I tell you through the honorable member | 1199.76
that if you find something special in it | 1202.559
and you feel that there is a need to improve it. | 1205.12
Because it is being | 1206.919
continuously monitored by our Ministry, it is being seen that the | 1209.12
work is completed on time, | 1211.76
whatever further time is given, we will complete it. | 
###
1213.76
Supplementary Sir, Speaker, | 1220.12
Sir, there is any | 1222.76
proposal for conversion of Baha Sali to Mission | 1227.32

###
1234.32
Railway Minister, | 1238.28
that to the knowledge of the Honorable Member, I have | 1243.84
also given him a letter about the schemes running in his area | 1246.559
and any such proposal that he has mentioned about a particular route is to | 1249.159
change it, in | 1253.0
this way my  Our ministry does | 1255.919
not have any proposal. If they | 1257.08
give a proposal, we will consider it. If it has to be | 1259.159
done, then the ministry should consider it. The | 1262.72
DPR should also be included in it. Based | 1265.96
on the question you have asked, the | 1267.6
department should also submit its DPR to change the proposal. | 1269.96
Action is underway by the Ministry | 1271.679
Bhajanlal Jatav | 
###
1273.799
Ad I would like to ask from your mother, Minister, | 1279.919
what are your criteria for declaring a National Highway. Yes, there are | 1286.279
three pilgrimage sites within my parliamentary constituency | 1289.08
and from Mumbai Expressway from Pinan | 1292.799
to Mahua.  Do you have the idea of ​​declaring Kaila Devi from Karauli and Karauli as a | 1295.64
national highway? Have you | 1301.44
been a PWD minister? Do you know how it is declared? That's why | 1304.799
ask the criteria.  | 
###
1309.52
Sir, Honorable Speaker, Honorable Speaker, yes, tell me that the honorable | 1313.32
member asked a question related to Maharashtra.  It is | 1315.559
not related to Maharashtra. | 1321.2
He asked | 1323.72
what is the policy of declaring National Highway. He had | 1325.84
done this in some questions but he did not | 1327.76
know about Rajasthan yet. He did | 1330.039
not ask about Rajasthan. He did | 1331.88
not give information about his Lok Sabha. | 1342.0
Sir, just a | 1346.52

in 2014, Honorable Speaker, there | 1355.52
were around 9281 Motor NHs and Honorable Prime Minister. | 1359.799

[Music] | 1380.88
Item Speaker | 1385.039
Sir Details Laid on the table Honorable | 1389.59
[Music] | 1396.799
Member Honorable Speaker | 1399.84
Sir Honorable Minister | 1402.53
[Praise] | 1404.6
which Honorable | 1408.96
Accepting the answer given by the Minister, the figures given in the answer given by the Minister are | 1415.559
a very big figure that since 2015, the | 1420.52
LED bulbs that have been distributed | 1423.279
through the Ujala scheme are | 1426.0
costing the country more than Rs 19,000 crore every year. | 1431.4
More savings are achieved, this is a very | 1436.919
commendable figure. It is also visible that many | 1440.919
states have made full use of this scheme | 1446.6
and have been able to distribute more LED bulbs. For | 1450.6
example, according to the data, Orissa, | 1454.44
Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, many small states also have a | 1458.32
large number of LED bulbs.  They were | 1461.12
able to distribute LED bulbs like Uttarakhand and Himachal | 1464.919
Pradesh, but the data shows that there are | 1467.76
some | 1469.0
big states in which LED bulbs could | 1472.76
not be distributed in that number. | 1476.08
According to their size, there are many big states which are bigger | 1479.159
than Uttarakhand and Himachal.  Less distribution has been done. | 1481.799
My question to the Honorable Minister is that | 1486.44
we hear that in many states there are | 1488.52
some local problems, there are some difficulties. | 1491.2
What is your question? The question is | 1493.44
what are such problems in many states. | 1496.48
Why is it more distributed in big states?  This is | 1498.48
not happening and how are they | 1500.84
planning to counter it?  | 
###
1505.399
Mr.Speaker, this was announced as an energy saving scheme so | 1509.36
that the common man's bill gets reduced and | 1513.32
he gets good lighting and this | 1516.159
voluntary scheme is for this reason.  It | 1518.76
was promoted through various modes. After that, the | 1523.0
interest taken by the states | 1525.159
depends on the availability of the bulb. It was | 1528.279
started because it was a new scheme, | 1530.76
hence some concessions were also allowed in it. | 1533.96
Later, the price was reduced because | 1536.919
within the market.  When it became popular, a lot of | 1539.279
bulbs came in the market. Now why are there fewer bulbs in that state? | 1541.96
Why are there more bulbs? The Discom department of the state should | 1550.76
also come forward in the promotion to save electricity in order to fix its distribution system.  In the | 1553.159
governments that come forward, the sale distribution of this bulb has been | 1556.399
good. In the governments that do | 1559.159
not come forward, the state governments, | 1561.399
this situation is very common. | 
###
1563.88
Honorable  Member Supplementary | 1565.64
Honorable Speaker Sir, India | 1569.44
's track record in energy savings in the last decade is | 1571.64
And it is very good in sustainability, it is | 1575.08
praised all over the world and this | 1578.76
is an example of the Ujala scheme which | 1581.96
we are discussing right now. My question is that the | 1584.96
technology of energy savings | 1588.48
keeps moving forward every year and various | 1591.52
types of  Electrical equipment has | 1593.84
LED bulbs, they have star ratings. By going through the | 1596.44
Energy Star Rating, | 1600.399
those with the highest ratings | 1603.36
save the most. My question | 1606.24
to the Honorable Minister is, what is his plan in the coming days? | 1609.64
Such schemes can be increased | 1614.399
so that higher star rated | 1617.0
product LED bulbs and electrical | 1618.88
equipment can be used. | 
###
1621.279
Honorable Minister, Speaker Sir, initially | 1629.279
when ESL Company, which is a Central Government CPSU, had started this project, | 1631.72
then one star bulbs were available | 1635.52
in the market only.  Later, after one star, | 1638.08
three star were also introduced. Now | 1640.48
considering the efficiency of one star and three star, | 1642.76
now all these markets which are private market have | 1644.96
come in it. Now the | 1647.919
bulbs of five star rating have been improved in it. | 1650.64
They supply whatever is available but | 1655.799
private players have not yet come in the five star market but | 1657.88
to further improve it, there are | 1660.36
enough bulbs available in the five star rating | 1662.6
and they are supplied at the rate of Rs 0 per bulb.  It is | 1666.32
still done this time and | 1669.679
approximately the number of bulbs that have been supplied, but | 1673.88
according to the data we have for the year, | 1678.72
around 13 lakh bulbs have been supplied and these have been supplied  | 
###
1682.24
Mr. Imran Masood | 1684.2
Ji, | 1687.08
Honorable Speaker, I, Honorable Minister. | 1693.919
How many bulbs were distributed in Uttar Pradesh since then | 1696.84
and while you are distributing bulbs, | 1702.2
our areas are incomplete where | 1704.559
electrification has not been done, will the Honorable | 1706.72
Minister complete the village electrification scheme | 1710.0
by sending money from the Centre? | 1714.0
We will do the work like Rajiv Gandhi | 1716.2
Yojana and Pandit Danal Yojana, is your Renew Gaon | 1719.039
or Majra, I am | 1722.12
talking about the small Majra, Sir, there | 1724.399
were two schemes, Pandit Deendayal Yojana, perhaps they were closed, so | 1726.64
what are the works that remained incomplete? | 1731.679
Will work to complete them,  | 
###
1735.36
Mr. Speaker, today there is a question regarding LED bulbs, so | 1737.84
as far as LEDs are concerned, the figure of Uttar Pradesh is | 1741.2
2.6 crore i.e. 2 | 1746.72
crore 2 crore 62 95000 bulbs have been distributed | 1750.88
and  In this, many governments | 1754.08
also did such a thing that by contributing from their side, they were | 1756.6
distributed free in some places and | 1759.279
cheap in some places, so | 1761.88
if the bulbs are to be distributed free in that market or in other places too, then | 1764.24
it is no cost no. | 1767.2
Sal works only on profit basis. If any | 1770.48
further promotion scheme is to be made then only the state | 1772.559
government will | 1776.24
make it.  |

1778.6
Question No. 145 She Mohammad | 1784.48
Hanifa Nabal Member Nabal | 1790.76
Minister Rebel Member Thank you | 1795.519
Sir | 1797.039
Sir Ladakh is a big district in terms of population | 1800.88
and this district is  It is cut off from the rest | 1804.159
of the country for five months in winter | 1806.519
and there has been a demand for | 1809.519
air connectivity there for the last 50-60 years. | 1812.12
A small | 1816.039
airport has been built there and | 1819.6
that too has been operational for the last 30 years.  If not, then | 1823.32
that airport has been taken under Udaan SIM twice, | 1825.679
yet air service has not started yet. | 1827.679
My question to the Rebel Minister is | 1832.08
that last two years ago, a | 1835.64
survey for a new airport in Kargil was | 1838.96
conducted there.  But till now there is no information about that survey, has | 1841.24
that survey been completed, | 1844.44
if it has been completed then what is its status | 1847.24
and the answer in this answer you have given that the | 1851.08
name of a place has been given there and if the feasibility | 1853.0
report has come negative then that is it.  Apart from this, is there any other | 1856.159
place there, do | 1858.679
you plan to conduct a survey there and build an airport there? | 
###
1862.72
Speaker Sir, the Government of | 1866.84
India has always been interested in | 1869.84
opening an airport there in Kargil Sir, with | 1872.12
civilian interest, we want civilians to have | 1874.36
access to air connectivity from | 1876.36
Kargil and regarding this we have tried our | 1879.36
side this administration | 1882.76
Ladakh administration has | 1886.919
identified the sites and we do the | 1889.0
inspection and according Wakha Kargil | 1891.84
Tutuk Dixit Yoma Padum Zanskar These are some | 1895.48
of the sites which have been offered to us | 1897.24
and we have done the  Inspection ther site | 1900.399
studies surveys have been done but after all that also because | 1903.32
the terrain is so challenging in | 1905.6
Kargil it was found to be very difficult to | 1908.08
operate an airport from those sites and | 1910.679
the other option that we have is the assisting | 1912.679
Kargil airport which is a  Defense | 1914.84
Airport Sir So because we want the | 1918.039
civilians to have access to the air | 1920.0
services we explore the idea of ​​why not | 1922.639
run the civilian aircraft from the | 1924.399
existing defense airport only and that | 1926.44
is where the International Civil Aviation | 1928.6
Organization came into the picture we | 1932.2
went  To IO And We Said Why Don't You | 1934.24
Inspect This Airport And Let Us Know If There Can Be | 1936.12
Civil Operations Also And They | 1938.6
Came In To The Picture And Once They Also Did | 1942.12
The Survey Sir Which Is I Think What The NAREL | 1944.48
Member Is Also Talking About  also | 1946.679
conducted the study and they also said that it | 1948.799
is very difficult to run from there which is | 1950.88
for the narrow body aircraft which is | 1952.84
a320 and b737 these aircrafts can't run | 1955.72
from there but we are we are interested | 1958.639
that the airport should run the civil  The airport | 1961.84
should run so and we should put it under the | 1964.76
RCS scheme also sir we have tried | 1967.399
more and more with the airlines also to run | 1969.559
specific routes but the challenge here is that | 1971.919
with the assisting airport even if it is | 1974.32
defense if you want to  Run civilian | 1975.76
aircrafts we can only run 90 seater | 1978.24
aircraft so we will work out with the | 1979.96
airline sir it is there under the RCA scheme also | 1982.039
Rs 9.2 crore have also been suction | 1985.32
30 lakh worth of small works like | 1987.919
electrical works have also been done there if | 1990.159
Some Airline Says That We Are Ready To | 1992.72
Provide Connectivity From Kargil To | 1994.799
Srinagar And Jammu Then We Are Ready To Do The | 1997.44
Remaining Work And Provide It For The | 1999.679
Civilian Purpose  | 
###
2004.88
Ln Member Supplementary Please Sir Ya Udan Scheme Twice Erase It | 2009.679
Honorable You All New  Members have also come, | 2014.399
we should maintain the discipline of the House, | 2017.76
you ask supplementary, after that | 2021.519
see you sir, in my opinion, this airport is | 2024.96
not of defense, it is a civil airport, it has been | 2026.639
listed for defense, so my opinion | 2029.639
is that the flight will be made from this airport in Sikkim. | 2032.12
Despite inclusion of AI twice, till now | 2034.84
no civil air service has been started there, what has been done about | 2037.519
this? Is there any plan of yours to start the 5060 seater | 2042.08
aircraft soon? | 
###
2046.96
Sir, earlier it was with AI and then | 2050.48
because of this.  Of the security aspect in a | 2053.399
Kashmir and Ladakh area, it has been handed | 2055.76
over to defenders and if we talk about 50 seater | 2058.2
aircraft, I just told you | 2059.879
sir that it is the airport of Assisting Kargil, the | 2062.72
runway there, the terrain | 2065.04
difficulty there, landing take off. | 2069.44
Sir, according to the protocol of 19 seater aircraft, | 2071.56
efforts are also going on with the airlines regarding the same. | 2075.079
Under the RCS Udan Scheme, the Honorable | 2078.44
Minister said that there | 2081.72
is a Udan scheme twice but we have also implemented it thrice.  Sir, I will continue to make more | 2083.76
efforts to | 2087.96
start a civilian aircraft from here.  | 
###
2091.72
NABAL Member Mr.Mia | 2094.56
Altaf Sir, I | 2098.119
want to specifically ask NABAL Minister Sahib that for the last many | 2102.56
years we have been hearing about Kargal Airport.  There is | 2104.8
no specific answer and | 2108.16
even today there is no specific answer. An entire | 2110.68
region is being cut off, | 2113.28
all the supplies there are stopped for seven months, | 2116.72
minus temperature remains there, so there | 2121.119
is no other way for them to meet with the country.  If there | 2124.0
is Ladakh, it is also very far from there, | 2127.079
Kashmir is closed for seven months, | 2129.92
so specifically, Minister sir, tell me that | 2132.839
you can fly any private or government, | 2135.76
whatever your airlines are, it is the duty of the government, | 2138.8
it is the responsibility of the government.  He wants to | 2141.88
talk to anyone but he should give six months of | 2144.76
service to the people there in Ventus, for | 2146.64
this I want your | 2149.24
personal intervention, I | 2151.44
want you to solve their issue. Thank you | 
###
2153.68
sir, we are honorable members.  We can understand the challenge | 2157.16
and the people there | 2163.2
can also understand the problem of disk connectivity. Under that, we had said | 2165.76
that every effort is being made from our side to | 2167.72
launch an aircraft from Kargil.  But | 2170.599
sir, it is not like that if we get a small air strip | 2173.4
and a big aircraft lands there, there is | 2175.2
also the issue of safety, so we will | 2177.359
have to follow the complete protocols, so according to the | 2179.92
length of the assisting runway, there will be | 2182.839
19  If only one seater | 2185.839
can land or take off there, then | 2188.28
according to what the honorable member said, | 2191.359
we will try with full dedication, we will | 2194.319
also talk to the airlines, | 2196.44
we would like to do it as soon as possible |

2199.16
Question No. 146 Shri  Janardan Mishra | 2205.839
ji, Honorable Minister, | 2208.52
Sir, the answer has been placed on the table of | 2211.48
Honorable | 2215.119
Members. Thank you, Chairman, | 2219.319
in the field of aviation, during the tenure of Prime Minister Modi, the | 2222.16
manner in which | 2224.96
airports have been constructed and the | 2227.2
number of aviation passengers has increased automatically.  This is | 2230.88
unprecedented and in an area like mine | 2233.68
where there is still lack of rail facilities, the | 2244.16
airport has been built due to the efforts of Modi ji and the then Civil Aviation Minister respected Jyotiraditya Scindia ji | 2248.119
and due to the | 2249.8
efforts of respected Ramanu Naidu ji.  The | 2253.839
process of licensing for operating the aircraft is | 2256.56
going on. | 2262.88
If we look at the manner in which the number of passengers has increased, then the DG | 2267.72
Yatra App that has been launched and the provisions made by the Minister | 2272.72
regarding the facilities for the passengers under it.  The | 2275.0
answer given explains a lot | 2278.359
of things but I | 2280.88
would like to ask if there is | 2286.72
any feedback mechanism in place to collect and improve the experiences of DG Yatra users. | 2289.319
If yes then please provide the details. | 
###
2295.44
Sir for | 2297.76
seamless contact travel.  DG Yatra was | 2301.04
launched in 2020 and | 2304.2
this distribution has also been done in our airports. Sir and we have been | 2307.16
getting excellent feedback and what the honorable member had | 2309.64
asked is that air airport feedback | 2312.96
mechanism is already established. Sir, | 2314.96
under that, Digi Yatra too, if anything.  If they | 2317.599
want to give feedback, then they | 2319.76
can definitely give it, that is its mechanism and | 2321.92
from our side too, how to improve Digi Yatra Pup and on | 2324.44
top of this, | 2327.56
we also do periodic reviews in our ministry too. | 2331.0
Sir, we also do reviews by doing reviews.  How can | 2332.96
we promote it in our way, this effort is | 2335.88
going on continuously sir and regarding this, | 2339.119
currently it is already established in 15 airports | 2341.839
sir, now it | 2345.839
is ready for launching in 12 more | 2347.72
airports and to be installed in 11 more. | 2350.44
We are also trying to Sir, now when this complete Digi | 2353.04
Yatra will be implemented in around 30 40 airports, when | 2356.359
90 of the population of the | 2359.24
country and the travelers who are using the | 2361.72
airports can use the Digi Yatra app so that | 2364.72
they can have  Contact A Contact Less | 2366.92
Travel at the Airport |

in this | 2387.52
Sir What has been the trend of increase in the number of registrations | 2393.28
If there is any translated data in this regard then I would like to give details of the same | 
###
2399.8
Sir DG Yatra Like A  Said is almost 15 | 2404.839
airports and are completely using it sir and is | 2408.72
ready for launch in 12 airports now | 2411.48
and an effort is going on to bring them in it in the next year in 11 airports | 2414.079
sir and | 2418.68
under this also how many people are utilizing it now. | 2422.72
Sir, we have the details | 2431.359
sir, I have data about them, now they have been separated, |

ji, Manish Tiwari ji, | 2445.68
Chairman, thank you very much, | 2449.44
Chairman, through you, I | 2452.56
want to ask the Honorable Minister, the | 2455.28
Supreme Court had given a decision, | 2458.88
Chairman.  Yes, the Right to Access Act was prepared by | 2487.44
30 members of Chandi House and Rajya Sabha, | 2490.56
in that law it was | 2494.92
said that there are three types of data, personal | 2499.04
data, | 2500.119
sensitive personal data and critical | 2504.28
personal | 2505.4
data.  Have replied | 2508.96
and I just want to read one line from it. With | 2511.72
your permission, Speaker, Digi Yatra | 2515.28
facial recognition technology based page has been | 2519.88
launched to provide seamless passenger free and faster | 2523.28
passenger processing at various check points | 2525.68
at the | 2526.56
airport. My question Mr. Speaker Sir is | 2529.88
Facial recognition technology | 2533.72
is sensitive and critical personal | 2537.28
data so critical personal data of millions | 2541.52
and millions of travelers who are | 2544.359
transiting through these airports is being | 2546.44
collected which | 2547.96
is the mechanism that the government has put in | 2552.44
place in order to ensure the integrity | 2557.079
of the data.  The price of both people is | 2561.319
protected and not if | 
###
2565.88
our thanks to Speaker Sir Sir the concern has been raised after | 2570.04
the noble member is concerned with the share and | 2572.8
especially the Government of India is very much | 2575.119
committed to protect the price of each and every | 2578.2
individual of  This country sir that much | 2580.2
I can assure you through this and how exactly | 2582.24
the Digi Yatra Pup is trite | 2584.64
achieve it sir first of all the PII the | 2587.24
personal identification | 2607.319
data is also not stored in any central | 2609.96
location hence the risk of data loss data | 2612.72
tuft and  Data breach does not arise and | 2615.96
also the PI data is shared directly | 2618.28
by the passenger and who ever is the verifying | 2620.88
agency for a very limited time limit so | 2624.559
after every 24 hours the data gets purged as it is | 2627.48
lost from the system entitled data | 2630.119
is there it  Is the data stored in the | 2632.359
individual smartphone of the own passenger | 2635.04
himself in the pup itself so there is | 2637.92
no so the verifying | 2641.079
agency which verifies the data and does only | 2644.24
gets it and it is authorized agency which is | 2647.0
enabled by the Central Government  It | 2648.64
verifies and the data gets purged after | 2652.4
this whole process is done so the data loss data thing | 2655.559
does not arise in the situation of DG | 2657.96
Yatra A  | 
###
2661.2
Smt. Supriya Sule Sir I appreciate the DG A its a very | 2664.88
good and very efficient page just in the | 2667.48
Interest of National Security I would like to | 2669.28
ask the rebel minister that when you are | 2673.079
traveling anywhere in the national interest | 2675.76
connected with the P is it compulsory for every | 2679.359
traveler to carry an Aadhaar card suppose I am | 2682.359
traveling on a ticket so does it otherwise in | 2686.48
Your Pup And Whenever I Travel Does The Name Have To | 2689.119
Match Each Other Because There Is A Story | 2692.119
In Maharashtra Which Is Very Alarming In | 2694.559
Delhi And Bombay Sir Is A Matter Of Very Concern There | 2697.16
Is A Passenger Who Claimed It Came In | 2699.44
The Newspaper So I Am  Just bringing that | 2701.079
to your notice that the man changed his name and | 2704.0
traveled so if | 2707.079
anyone can go like this in technology so there are checks and | 2709.119
balances people can't so the Aadhaar card is | 2712.48
critical for identification and how will you | 2714.88
identify | 2727.0
security issue and  Happened at Daily And | 2729.16
Thank You And Is It A Criminal Offense If | 2732.4
You Don't Travel  | 
###
2736.079
Like I Mentioned Sir While We Protect The Data Of Each And Every | 2740.319
Passenger The Also National Security Is A | 2742.72
Very Important Aspect And When We Are | 2744.68
Talking About DIGI  Yatra specifically the | 2747.599
name is | 2749.119
to have to collate with the Aadhaar also because it takes | 2754.52
Aadhaar into account and in future | 2757.2
just to enhance the security side of it we | 2759.68
are taking the passport data also so | 2761.8
that better security system is in place | 2764.0
but for the moment this  The name has to match the | 2767.8
Aadhaar so that this verification is generally | 2770.64
done at the entrance gate CISF point itself if it is | 2773.2
not done through DG Yatra also everyone would have | 2775.48
encountered the | 2777.319
situation where they are going with the boarding | 2779.48
pass and the first thing  They show as a | 2785.92
verifiability check the name also so it has to | 2788.16
match and the passenger is allowed | 2792.559
to | 2793.88
travel  |

2796.599
Question No. 147 Shri Dinesh Chandra Yadav 147 Honorable | 2802.24
Minister | 2805.319
Narel | 2810.16
Member Speaker | 2813.359
Sir My question from Patna Purnia | 2818.16
Expressway  Regarding the construction of the road which will go from Patna to | 2821.559
Bidupur Dalsingh Sarai Simri Bakhtiyarpur | 2824.359
like Kishanganj Purnia, the | 2830.839
Honorable Minister in the 17th Lok Sabha met the | 2835.319
respected Gadkari Saheb on 18th March 2021 for its construction and | 2839.319
he approved it | 2844.44
and also made provision for it in the last budget.  Provision has been made. | 2848.88
I thank him profusely from my heart and on behalf of the people of my area. | 2857.24
My question in this, | 2860.68
Mr. Speaker, has come in response to this question that if a | 2864.4
consultant has been appointed to prepare its DPR, | 2867.839
then the DPR | 2870.64
282 was given for preparation only in 2023, | 2874.079
so I want to know from the Honorable Minister | 2877.24
that it has been a long time and there is | 2881.96
no estimate date for the project and in how many days this process | 2884.64
will be completed.  | 
###
2888.52
Honorable Minister, Honorable Speaker, as the Honorable Member has said.  It has been | 2890.64
informed that the Patna Padiya Motorway | 2893.839
which is connected to the National Highway NH and the State | 2896.559
Highway of our state | 2899.599
and since | 2902.119
it has been completely constructed in the NH, | 2907.2
we have also mentioned about the process of DPR in the answer to the question.  You have been told | 2908.88
that consent has been given, hence the DPR | 2911.88
work is going on and | 2914.48
further action will be taken on it immediately after the DPR work is done. | 
###
2923.319
Mr. Member Chairman, in section C of this question, regarding the work of NH 106 | 2928.28
and | 2928.96
107.  This question related to the delay | 2933.52
was on NH 107 which goes from Purnia Maheshkar to | 2938.72
Saharsa Purnia. Work contractors were invited in two sections | 2943.079
and the first | 2946.28
section was from Mahesh Kut to | 2949.28
Madhepura whose work | 2955.119
started in 20112 2019 and the work was to be completed completely. | 2958.72
Earlier, but I had met the Honorable Minister several times, | 2962.16
then the last date was March 24, | 2966.0
but still not more than 60 work was | 2969.24
done. Honorable Sir, one minute, one minute is too | 2972.559
long, why do you ask? It is not long, there is | 2974.96
another section in it which is Madhepura.  Purnia, | 2978.64
its work was started in 2018, it should have been completed | 2981.96
in December 2nd, it did not happen | 2985.559
and in this, NH 106, its work was | 2990.28
started in 1310 2016 but it was to be completed in | 2994.599
2019, but that too could not be done, so we are asking the | 2998.559
Honorable Minister for this.  I would like to request | 3000.96
that NH work should be taken up on priority because | 3004.4
respected Gadkari Saheb gets it done at the | 3007.52
speed of airplanes, but the | 3009.799
two small rich NHs here are getting | 3012.319
delayed a lot and the work is not being done, | 3014.92
hence till when. | 
###
3018.599
Chairman, Sir, the honorable member raised | 3021.96
a concern that NH 106 from | 3025.4
Veerpur to Veerpur and that 106 are actually two | 3029.799
projects which are | 3032.68
funded by the World Bank. Upgradation | 3034.359
work is being done in it and there are two roads in it. | 3039.04
It is to be built with Pap Soldiers and it is going to | 3042.24
cost Rs 780 crore. | 3046.16
You are right that it is a little late, it is | 3049.319
due to the delay in the work. | 3053.799
At present, all those problems have been solved. | 3057.28
Work on 82 is the first in this.  It has been completed in phase | 3062.04
and | 3064.48
we will complete it in December 2024. | 3067.64
You have asked about the second phase of the first phase and the | 3070.88
second project which is 106 kilometers long. It also has a seed of 100 kilometers | 3073.96
on the Kosi river and this road | 3077.799
along with the entire approach road is about 30 kilometers long.  There | 3080.839
is a little delay in this also, we will | 3084.2
complete it in August 2025. You have also raised questions about one Mahesh Kut | 3088.079
and Punia Motor Mark in this, so | 3091.319
those | 3093.319
questions are answered, Honorable Speaker, I | 3096.4
want to inform that this is also a 90 km. | 3099.0
This is NH, it is worth 662 crores, it was | 3103.799
given 2 years time in this also because now the | 3106.64
work is progressing fast, work on 75 has been done, | 3110.92
we will do its first phase in 2025, | 3113.64
in the second phase it is of 88 km | 3117.16
which is 280 km.  It was worth crores of rupees, now the | 3120.799
work is in progress, work on this has also been done on 73 | 3124.319
because in this road you had mentioned in 106 | 3127.64
that the one from Manikpur Chowk | 3129.839
because there is a portion in the middle of it, the | 3132.079
work is in the middle due to some reason.  A bridge | 3135.64
has to be built, a beach has to be built and a flyover has to be built. You have | 3137.68
also given a fast pace to the work of that flyover. | 3140.559
Madhe Pula Puniya. | 3145.4
I want to answer your questions about this and that from the | 3147.2
information I have, | 3149.16
we can complete it in 2025.   | 
###
3153.92
Smt. Sandhya Rai Thanks Chairman, Sir, I want to | 3156.92
tell the Honorable Minister through you that | 3158.799
NS 92, which is the | 3164.079
road lifeline of Bhend Lok Sabha constituency and this road has been | 3167.52
single for many years, has not been made double, | 3171.839
although through the Central Government. | 3174.599
Approval has been given for six lines of the road. PR has | 3177.24
also been approved by some company, | 3180.16
but through you I | 3181.92
would like to tell the Honorable Minister that | 3184.48
24 black points were made on this road by the government, which are | 3187.28
becoming victims of accidents every day.  The | 3189.559
people of my area have | 3191.88
suffered losses to their families due to many accidents and within seven days there have been | 3194.079
three major accidents in which | 3196.2
hundreds of people have been injured and some untimely deaths have | 3198.839
also taken place. So, through you, I make this | 3201.16
request to the Honorable Minister. | 3206.04
Work on this road should be done as soon as possible so that the people of my area get benefit. | 
###
3210.76
Honorable Speaker, if this is your second | 3215.799
question then you have mentioned that | 3218.68
Clear Bhind Etawah Patter Road which | 3223.92
is NH 719 and some part of it is already four lane.  The | 3235.079
work on its DPR is going on and on the basis of steady traffic, | 3239.04
I would like to inform you | 3242.119
that we are taking DPR action on it. | 3245.24
Only after the DPR action is taken, | 3247.559
further action will be taken on it because the 108 | 3250.88
kilometer long road. | 3253.2
DPR has been given on the road,  | 
###
3257.799
Mr. Pappu Yadav ji Pappu | 3260.599
Yadav, Minister Sir, you have talked about building 20 on Purnia, | 3266.359
Saharsa and 106 on Birpur, on Birpur to | 3270.44
Birpur, you have talked about building a big pool on Kosi, | 3273.72
when the next time you | 3277.599
went 4 years ago.  Madhepura, there | 3280.44
they had announced many NHKs and we | 3284.48
all were there continuously, from 4 years ago | 3288.839
till today, as many NHKs were announced, be it via | 3291.92
Saharsa to Supaul, whether it was the | 3295.24
matter of over bridge on Supaul.  That | 3299.28
is the NH which connects Araria via Supaul, | 3302.28
so you have not raised this matter even once. | 3305.599
Our MP has | 3308.2
mentioned this many times, like the | 3310.68
over bridge in Bajnathpur is still hanging there.  The | 3313.839
continuous efforts of Dagri Saheb | 3317.64
definitely deserve gratitude and | 3320.319
thanks and I thank him for his continuous | 3324.319
efforts, but almost all the | 3326.359
projects in Bihar are illegal, whether it is | 3330.2
due to lack of money or | 3333.16
because of the agency.  But there is a need to take it seriously | 3336.0
and for how many months of 25th, whether you are | 3342.72
planning to go from Purnia and Birpur to Birpur and Nai Purgona from Naugachhia to Rupauli, is there | 3350.48
any provision for taking new NH in Ku Kosh Seemanchal? | 3353.079
Many thanks, | 
###
3357.4
Honorable Speaker, since | 3363.52
another route has been mentioned by the Honorable Member, but | 3365.559
I take cognizance of that too, | 3368.16
we will look into that too, but as | 3370.559
our National Highways within Bihar are about 56, the | 3373.28
total length of which is  There are 6133 kilometers | 3377.359
in which over bridges have also been built and | 3380.16
motor roads are also there. If the honorable member has a | 3382.28
specific question then you will give me the | 3384.2
answer and I will give you the answer. | 
###
3389.599
Kirti Azad ji, it is time to ask in short, | 3391.68
I will ask the question very briefly | 3394.4
because  This | 3396.4
question is also related to Bengal. I | 3400.52
would like to know from the Honorable Minister, | 3402.48
how many schemes have been approved in West Bengal in the last 10 years, | 3404.72
how many have been completed and how many are | 3407.48
incomplete. Out of these, there is no work in my area | 3410.2
from East Bardhaman to Durgapur area | 3412.68
since last one year.  Is it going on and has the | 3415.799
Minister received letters | 3418.44
from the Child Welfare Society and farmers that the | 3423.48
need for PU and vehicle underpass has been taken into consideration, | 
###
3427.52
Honorable Speaker, as | 3431.4
given by the Honorable Member?  That is | 3434.039
because this was a question about two states and three | 3436.44
states but there | 3438.96
was mention of a specific road. Honorable | 3442.039
Member, this is your road, you will make it | 3444.039
available to me, currently there are | 3446.96
about 35 NHs in West Bengal in which | 3450.64
about  There are 3910 kilometers of NH motor road of two lanes, four lanes and six lanes | 3456.24
and | 3458.839
you have mentioned this about the accident, this is a | 3462.359
separate subject, I have given you the details of this | 3466.319
and whatever specific question you have, you will provide me the answer to it. | 
###
3471.72
Abhay Kumar Sinha | 3477.88
President Sir, | 3480.48
what would I like to draw the attention of the Honorable Minister through you, that | 3483.96
NH 139 which runs from Patna | 3488.68
via Paliganj Arbal via Dawat Nagar and | 3491.92
connects Aurangabad and Jharkhand border Hariyar Gun, was | 3496.48
approved for four lanes in it. | 3499.72
I would like to make this request to the Honorable Minister, | 3502.88
because the | 3505.2
four lane work has already been completed in the area of ​​Jharkhand up to Harier Ganj, | 3508.16
but | 3511.24
in the area of ​​Bihar, the work of four lane from Patna to Harier Ganj is still | 3514.44
pending, our request would be that it should be completed as | 3518.24
soon as possible.  Its DPR etc. has been | 3521.72
submitted soon. Please make efforts to get it constructed as soon as possible | 3524.44
and Sir, I | 3527.079
would like to make one more request that in any project which takes | 3529.88
so much delay for two, two, four, four years, five or | 3533.2
five years, the work is over.  It | 3537.64
was to be completed in 18, then it was to be completed in 2022 | 3541.119
and the four-lane road was divided among three sensors, | 3545.44
that too is still incomplete, this is | 3548.92
not yet completed, this is the reason for the delay | 3552.24
and on whom will the burden go. Thank you, | 
###
3556.599
Sir.  Honorable Speaker, the way it was | 3560.079
defended by other members that | 3562.359
Harihar Jharkhand four lane work is going on, | 3565.079
along with the speed of its work, you have | 3567.64
expressed concern about the DPR work of Patna work which | 3570.96
you had specifically mentioned. | 3573.599
The alignment is going on and | 3575.92
is in the final position, further work will be completed. | 3578.359
You have asked a question related to this | 3581.799
that this work has not been completed on time. | 3583.88
This is true in many places | 3586.839
because whenever a new motor route is constructed.  When the | 3589.599
process of making that road starts, then | 3591.68
with the cooperation of the state government, the | 3594.16
process of making that road also takes time because there are forest resources | 3595.88
and the villagers who come to the local villages | 3599.24
also come along with them, the process of land acquisition | 3602.24
takes time and it takes time. | 3604.72
Only after the DPR is | 3608.079
submitted to the Ministry, the money is approved | 3609.76
and then tendering and other types | 3611.52
of processing take place, hence it | 3614.48
takes time, but along with increasing the time, the | 3616.839
responsibility of completing the work also lies with the Ministry.  It is | 3618.72
taken by the government and | 3620.599
you have also said that it will be completed. | 3623.2
Work on this is also going on. It should be completed on time. | 3627.799
Question Hour is | 3629.599
over. Honorable members, I want to speak on | 3632.799
my behalf. |
