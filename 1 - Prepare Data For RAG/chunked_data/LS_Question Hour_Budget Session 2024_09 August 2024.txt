Question | 5.399
Hour Question No. 261 | 10.48
261 Shri Girdhari | 15.88
Yadav Hon'ble Minister | 18.4
on Honorable | 23.119
Member Establishment of the post of High Court | 26.56
in the Central list and | 31.4
in a state like Bihar with a population of 13 crores, there is only one High | 34.239
Court and no bench.  No, whereas | 36.92
in a state with less population, the High Court has one High Court | 40.0
and two benches. Is the establishment of a bench in the Central List? | 43.16
If so, is the Government of India planning to | 51.199
establish a High Court bench in Bhagalpur in Bihar or in any other area of ​​Bihar? | 
###
56.8
Honorable Speaker Sir, | 60.559
I want to tell the honorable member through you | 66.4
that the High Court Bench is established as per the recommendation of the Jaswant Singh | 70.159
Commission | 71.72
and the decision given by the Supreme Court. | 74.28
Under this, the | 78.84
Chief Justice and Governor of the High Court are concerned. | 83.079
With the consent, the complete proposal is sent by the State Government to the | 85.88
Central Government for consideration. | 88.88
Once the | 92.36
proposal comes for consideration, the necessary | 95.56
infrastructure facility and expenditure for the batch is | 98.36
provided by the State Government. | 100.119
This process is based on the decision of Jaswant Singh Commission and the | 103.32
Supreme Court.  It has been decided by the Government of India | 105.399
and hence I want to say that those who are | 109.32
talking about Bihar, | 112.28
at present there is no proposal under consideration related to opening the bench of Patna High Court in Bhagalpur or Purnia. | 
###
120.52
Honorable Speaker Sir, when the High Court and the | 124.2
bench  The establishment is in the Central List, | 126.399
not in the State List, nor in the Concurrent List, | 128.28
when why would any Chief | 130.679
Justice or Governor talk about the Central List? In a public welfare | 132.959
state, it is the responsibility of the Government of India to question | 138.48
what is the question in a state with a population of 13 crores.  The question | 141.2
is that when the Center is in the list, then there is | 143.04
Governor and High Court in it. Should the Government of India make | 144.72
efforts in this direction? Should they | 146.44
establish a High Court in Bihar, which has a population of 13 crores? | 148.4
Minister, add it to number 78 and 79 in the list. | 
###
150.64
You, Honorable Speaker | 155.16
Sir, Honorable Member are also aware | 158.72
that the country is run according to the Constitution, there | 161.159
is a provision for the Supreme Court in the Constitution, there is | 163.2
a decision of the Supreme Court and | 166.44
also the recommendation of the Jaswant Singh Commission, this | 169.44
process has been decided in which any High | 171.959
If | 174.8
a bench of the High Court is to be established in the state, then it should | 177.8
bring the proposal of the High Court, get the consent of the state, | 181.159
also bring the consent of the Governor, after that the | 183.239
matter will come up for consideration, the process has been decided, it is not the day for consideration right now | 
###
187.36
Mr. Rajesh | 191.48
Ranjan  Even before the Honorable Minister, | 194.72
Ravi Shankar ji had written a long letter. | 197.04
You should study it. | 201.36
According to the National Judicial Data, you will remember the Law Commission | 204.84
125th report. You have seen it, it is clear in it | 209.12

Answer  In the state of Bihar, | 235.799
I request that | 238.439
almost 237 cases are still pending in the High Court in Bihar. | 242.079
Mr. President, the situation in the Patna High Court | 245.56
is that just a few days ago, there | 248.92
is no place for the lawyer to stay in Patna, so | 251.239
in the below  Sitting lawyer sir in the High Court, | 253.84
I am telling that the | 256.72

Pur Peepal.  Can't come to Patna, it's a distance. | 269.479
Yes, he will not get justice. Similarly, Bettiah | 273.44
Chhapra Sir Gopalganj Muzaffarpur has two benches | 277.759
and one | 280.36
Purnia. Raj government has sent the proposal. High | 283.24
Court will send the proposal. Honorable Minister, | 
###
285.44
tell me if you clear it, I will | 289.639
again send this to the honorable member through you.  I want to make it clear | 293.8
that the | 297.44
Supreme Court has | 300.52
fixed some procedures in the recommendations of the Jaswant Singh Commission. Under that procedure, | 303.199
first the High Court in the state concern and the state | 305.199
government will | 307.28
consider all the initiatives and reach a mutual agreement regarding setting up a new bench.  The | 310.0
Chief Justice of the High Court, the | 313.08
Chief Minister of the State Government and then the Governor will | 316.16
agree that if such a proposal comes then | 318.96
no such proposal has come yet, this is what | 320.759
I told them, apart from the | 323.8
25 principal seats of 25 High Courts in the country, | 326.08
this is fine.  That there are a total of 15 in which 13 | 330.72
permanent benches and two circuit benches are working. | 
###

so accept the answer given by the minister, I | 362.08

Kumar should talk to the Honorable Chief Minister | 373.8

court in Paschimanchal of Orissa. | 470.68
Honorable Speaker Sir, what decision has the Central Government taken for setting up the Circuit Bench? The |

in which there is a provision related to conducting | 482.24
all proceedings in the Supreme Court and High Court in English language, | 484.479
yet 348 | 488.72
It has also been provisioned that the | 490.52
Governor of a State, with the consent of the President, | 496.28
can authorize the use of regional language in the High Court of that State and | 499.319

Honorable | 564.72
Minister.  Speaker | 567.04
Sir, through you I want to tell the Honorable Member | 570.079
that the Center has Tamil Nadu, | 572.56

619.12
Manish Tiwari Very much Mr. Speaker Sir | 623.36
Mr.  Speaker Sir Article 3481 A of the | 628.36
Constitution of | 629.32
India provides that the language of the | 632.279
Supreme Court and the High Courts will be | 634.48
in English Article | 638.12
3482 provides that even if the language | 642.519
of some High Court could be Hindi and some other | 645.8
regional language but the judgments decree  And | 650.2
orders will be in English and there is a | 653.079
logic to that and the logic is that there should be a | 655.8
standardization of authoritative | 658.839
text | 659.959
across the board now the Minister in reply has | 664.839
referred to an initiative by the Supreme | 667.399
Court of India where the Supreme Court is | 670.48
using  An Artificial Intelligence Tool to | 674.32
Translate Judgments into Various Regional | 678.2
Languages ​​My question to the Minister is what is | 682.44
the integrity of the | 686.12
translation Who will certify | 689.68
that the translation from the original judgment | 693.24
is correct primer because the translation is | 697.279
not being done by the judge who is the judge  Authored the | 700.079
Judgment and even if you look at section 1 | 704.56
of the Official Languages ​​Act of India | 707.44
which Mr Minister you have referred to in | 709.88
your answer it says that the only | 715.519
recognized authoritative text will be the | 719.6
text that has been translated into English | 722.68
and certified.  By the High Court So my | 725.44
question is that you have given permission that there | 731.0
will be translation in the regional languages, | 734.76
translation has also been done, now if any lawyer | 743.959
gives any argument on its basis in any court, then who will certify that the late | 749.8
judgment?  Its substance, its tenor, | 754.839
its translation, its | 758.04
interpretation are exactly the same as | 761.839
in the original English Judgment and the language in which the | 765.079
Judgment was written. | 769.32
Who will ticket it? Who will vouch for its integrity, | 
###
775.519
Sir?  Through you, I | 782.68
want to say through you the important issue raised by Manish Tiwari ji | 787.44
that along with ease of living, Modi government is | 791.44
also promoting ease of justice. Just listen for a minute and look at | 794.36
this judicial ease. | 797.88
Keeping this in mind, | 800.839
judicial | 804.399
proceedings and judgments are being | 807.24
translated into regional languages ​​through technology and artificial intelligence based tools. Now | 809.36
who is monitoring what they asked, | 817.079
through artificial intelligence based speech app and Supreme Court legal translation software software Suvas. | 820.279
At present, the | 822.639
translation is being done for the English judges, who also | 825.279
said that the | 827.88
actual | 831.04
information regarding the status of the Supreme Court case, daily order, judgment etc. is being made available in the multi-lingual app of the Supreme Court in | 834.0
six languages, including English, | 837.759
Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, Tamil and Telugu. | 840.519
Next to this is the Supreme | 842.88
Court which is a judge and a Justice. | 846.36
An | 850.399
Artificial Intelligent Assistant Legal | 853.04
Translation Advisory Committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Abhey S. Oak and it is | 855.88
regularly monitoring it only after that it is | 857.92
taken forward | 862.16
thanks to that.  The judgment is being translated. Is | 865.88
that translation correct? | 
###
877.44
No. Question number 263 Mr. | 882.519
Gaurav Gag | 887.04
ji Advocate Adhar Prakash Mangni | 894.88
ji Sir Question number 263 | 900.16
Sir statement is not on the table oh | 908.8
sir so many youth are | 912.6
recruited for the | 915.0
job.  By the false | 918.399
agency of high | 921.399
salary but unexpectedly our | 925.48
youth cheated | 929.199
not getting salary of | 931.92
fund sir for my firm my | 935.44
neighbor recruited for run army on false promise | 940.759
of | 942.639
job taken up with external a | 948.0
ministry and law of mum are really satisfied with | 953.12
it | 955.8
Regarding incidents of fake | 959.519
promises to foreign countries are increasing, many such | 964.36
incidents | 967.279
including recruitment of youth to | 970.079
Cambodia | 971.959
and Myanmar for cyber crime as slaves which are reported recently, | 978.6
fake agencies are very active and | 983.319
jealous of their victims by | 986.68
government.  In this agency | 992.319
targeting Indian | 994.199
youth sir my question is what are the findings of | 998.88
inquiry and action has been taken | 1003.6
against the | 1005.279
agency same as in the arrest of any | 1009.72
Indian citizen recruitment agent and corporate | 1014.8
in the false recruitment | 
###
1021.279
to Russia we have in total 91  Cases so far | 1027.6
of Indian Nationals who have been recruited into the | 1032.0
Russian Army at least | 1036.0
14 of them have unfortunately passed away 14 of them have been discharged and in | 1040.679
some manner have come back with an | 1044.24
assistant and there are 69 Indian citizens who are | 1049.039
awaiting release from the Russian Army Sir.  S My | 1053.16
answer is also convey to the male member We | 1057.6
take this issue very very | 1060.039
seriously I have myself raised it numerous | 1063.28
times with the Russian Foreign Minister nor | 1066.2
Prime Minister Was in Moscow last month I | 1069.16
raised it personally with President Putin | 1072.039
and he got President  The issue arises that any | 1075.52
Indian | 1076.52
national who is in the service of the Russian Army | 1080.159
will be discharged and released. The problem is that | 1083.64
the Russian authorities maintain that those Indian | 1087.64
nationals | 1088.799
entered into contract for service with the | 1091.88
Russian Army do not | 1095.159
necessarily subscribe to  That I | 1099.36
share the NARAL members view I think in many | 1102.36
cases there are reasons to indicate that our | 1105.0
nationals are misled that they were being told that they were | 1108.0
going for some other job and that they were then | 1112.24
deployed with the Russian Army | 1115.36
Regarding sir the NARAL members question | 1119.28
What action we have taken because the main | 1122.12
question pertains to people with the Russian | 1126.4
Army I would like to inform the NARAL member | 1129.4
through you sir that the CBI has registered a | 1133.2
criminal case against 19 individuals and | 1136.36
entities they have examined | 1138.84
the people do 14 | 1143.76
People Who Have Returned From Russia A | 1147.44
Sufficient Evidence Has Surface Against 10 | 1151.559
Human Traffickers Whose Identity We Know During The | 1154.919
Investigation Two Of The | 1157.159
Accused Were Arrested On 24th Of April | 1160.48
And Two More On The Seventh Of May All The Four | 1164.08
Accused Are Presently In Judicial Custody | 1167.679
Sir  The male member also referred to this to a | 1172.76
different issue which is the cyber trafficking of | 1176.0
people who are being misled taken to South | 1178.48
East Asia and made to work on cyber | 1181.2
scams | 1182.52
and related issues again sir we take this very | 1186.799
very seriously we have taken it up  With all the | 1189.44
concern government at political level so far | 1193.48
650 Indian nationals have been repatriated | 1196.559
from Cambodia | 1199.08
415 from Myanmar and 548 from Laos so | 1204.36
as the male member has not noticed sir and we the | 1207.799
government also appreciates the gravity | 1210.24
of this issue this is an issue for which  We | 1213.28
have to be very vigilant We have to crack | 1215.76
down very hard So I have also attached with | 1219.159
the answer sir a list of cases state wise | 1223.36
for the last three years What is the action | 1225.919
taken report What is the status of legal proceeding in these cases |

Unfortunately in one case from Haryana the | 1470.48
Russian Foreign Ministry has informed us about his | 1472.919
death they have sent DNA test | 1476.399
report for identification | 1498.36
neither side has | 1500.0
requested for DNA sample that | 1503.24
DNA sample is being provided and | 1505.76
finally in the case | 1509.48
of from Uttar Pradesh the eighth case  The family has | 1514.24
sent the wishes that the mortal remains should be brought | 1516.919
back. We expect it to be brought back. Regarding the people who have | 1519.88
evolved in the | 1522.88
trafficking, we will have to go by the | 1526.799
CBI inquiry has told us because that is the | 1530.64
evidence.  As per legally permitted we | 1534.159
have 19 people including sir some of the names that the | 1539.96
male member has referred to in each | 1545.84
case the inquiry is going on in many | 1549.76
cases the prosecution is going on so I can | 1552.84
know the male member through you sir that we  Take | 1555.44
this very very seriously This last point is | 1559.12
what is the status of discussions between us | 1561.919
and the Russian Government I think it would be fair to say that | 1565.64
after the Prime Minister | 1568.36
himself has taken up the matter with the Russian | 1570.96
President and the Russian President has | 1573.12
himself given  Unless we should jump the | 1576.799
gun and say the Russians are not serious on this | 1579.159
matter I think it is important to hold the | 1582.84
Russian government to the word it is for us | 1586.32
most important we are not our score | 1588.96
point or to enter into the debate our  To get | 1592.039
back two 69 people because Indian citizens should | 1596.08
not be serving in the army of their country |

Shri M Srinivas Ready, such a minister has | 1602.919
given the answer in very detail sir thank | 1609.32
you sir thank you very much speaker | 1615.64

Sir with Assistant to Hubli Minister for | 1636.12
External Affairs We are extremely | 1638.52
thankful to you sir sir  In this light of this | 1642.2
instant I want to ask you our honorable | 1644.64
minister to give specific measures the | 1647.72
government is taking to crack down on | 1650.08
immigration | 1651.48
agents who actively participate in such | 1654.24
illegal activities in India sir thank you | 1656.6
thank you sir  | 
###
1662.36
the bulk of the cyber related  Trafficking cases are the | 1666.399
highest number of cases are from Andhra | 1668.559
Pradesh and to some extent from Telangana | 1671.32
so I completely understand the male members | 1675.159
concerns in this regard and I also want to | 1677.72
set in every case because if you the | 1682.88
male members would look at the data we  Have | 1686.0
provided the majority of cases are Andhra | 1691.159
Pradesh Karnataka Kerala Punjab Rajasthan | 1696.36
Tamil Nadu and Telangana The bulk of the cases are | 1699.0
less so we have seen the cooperation of the | 1704.12
state government It is an issue of national | 1706.24
concern This is not a political matter This is a | 1709.6
case  Where both the State Government is concerned and the | 1712.12
Union Government should work together and I | 1714.519
can bear the noble member to waive we find | 1717.679
evidence of any violation of the law we will | 1720.279
very quickly procure the agent |

Sir Honorable Minister Sir | 1739.48
Answer on the Table  Honorable | 1743.679
Member Respected Speaker, I am speaking through you | 1747.0
to the Minister in the | 1751.2
answer to the question given by the Minister that | 1753.48
according to Article 171 of the Constitution, the | 1757.559
Rajya Sabha and the Legislative Councils of various states, what | 1760.519
is your question? My question is that | 1765.44
according to the Constitution, | 1773.0
Regarding reservation being implemented in Legislative Council and Rajya Sabha as per the Constitution, | 1777.24
I want to tell | 1779.559
that no one is made available for it. | 1782.84
This is true, but I | 1785.32
would like to tell the Minister through you | 1788.24
that the respected  Sir, don't take the name of Sangh leader Mohan ji | 1791.2
Bhagwat. Honorable member, you are a new | 1794.84
comer, remove the name of the person who is not a member of this House | 1798.48
and from now on, if everything is understood, then | 1801.279
I will say that even today, | 1804.48
discrimination against castes and tribes in the society has | 1807.2
ended in the country.  No, it would be appropriate to make a provision for reservation for this community, | 1812.72
therefore, through you, I | 1814.96
request the Honorable Minister to ensure reservation in the | 1817.279
Rajya Sabha and the Legislative Council of the country by amending the Constitution. | 
###
1823.679
Honorable Speaker | 1826.039
Sir, through you I request the Hon.  I | 1829.08
want to tell the member that there | 1832.36
is a provision for reservation in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies based | 1835.399
on the Constitution, but in the Rajya Sabha and the | 1839.24
Legislative Council, there is | 1842.679
no provision for reservation under the Constitution. | 
###
1849.44
Sir, I want to ask a supplementary. Those who are standing without calling their names. | 1853.679
Honorable | 1855.72
members, please, in this regard, | 1859.48
my second supplementary question | 1863.6
is that those who will stand without being called, they will not | 1866.96
get a chance. Listen to my second supplementary, I | 1874.679
assume you do not want to ask a supplementary, | 1877.32
sir, I want to ask | 1880.6
mine, my | 1882.88
respected Chairman.  The | 1886.919
second supplementary question to the Honorable Minister | 1889.76
is that just last week, | 1894.84
in the case related to reservation, the Honorable Supreme Court gave the classification of quota within quota, | 1899.279
which is being criticized in the entire country | 1903.24
and there is huge anger among these castes | 1905.84
and OK in the entire country. | 1908.36
Not a question but about it, | 1911.159
one side of the incident team of Government of India is also in the Supreme | 1914.24
Court, I would say that | 
###
1919.0
Honorable Speaker Sir, the | 1921.32
supplementary that he has asked is | 1924.2
not related to this question, still I | 1926.159
want to tell through you that sub category exclusion. | 1929.76
In the matter of off-caste, which was pending with the Punjab Government and | 1934.2
came to the Supreme Court via Andhra, the one who is | 1936.639
talking about the creamy layer is the observation of some of the | 1938.6
judges of the Supreme Court in the creamy layer, it is | 1943.679
not a part of the decision.  Don't try to spread confusion in the society. |

###
1974.039
Sir, I want to tell the honorable member through you that | 1977.88
Question Hour is only | 1979.32
technical Sir, the question | 1982.399
asked by him is answered only and | 1984.96
as I said, this provision is made in Article 80.  It has been said | 1989.559
that the | 1993.48
Members of Parliament as representatives of each state in the Rajya Sabha are elected | 1996.72
by the MLAs of the Legislative Assembly of the respective state | 1999.84
and while there is a direct election in the Lok Sabha, the | 2003.84
difference between direct and indirect elections is also discussed in the Kansa Assembly at | 2006.12
that time.  This was done just now, that is why we are saying | 2009.0
that this is not a provision in the Constitution right now, this is what | 2011.76
I have said, |

by  The Government of India through the Ministry | 2047.12
of Health and Family Welfare | 2051.24
is now the international regulatory body regulating | 2057.119
veterinary | 2064.2
medicine   | 
###
2066.72
as I have explained in my reply but I would like | 2069.44
to explain again that world wide there are | 2071.8
three models of regulatory bodies that we | 2074.079
follow for human  As Well As Veterinary | 2077.079
Drugs and Medicines There Are There Are There Are | 2079.839
Countries Like USA | 2084.56
EU Japan | 2087.56
And There Are Countries Like USA EU | 2090.8
Japan And New Zealand Which Follow A Common | 2093.879
Regulatory Body Then There Are Second Category | 2096.679
Of Countries Like The UK Like China Like | 2100.839
Brazil  Like Australia which has a | 2104.44
separate regulatory body system and they are in this | 2108.079
third category where in the countries | 2110.8
following a model they have a main national | 2113.72
regulatory authority body and with in which they have a | 2116.44
dedicated veterinary division so | 2119.2
India falls in that third model where  We have | 2122.96
one regulatory body and within which we | 2126.119
have a separate dedicated division for veterinary | 2129.04
drugs and medicines that is how we have the | 2132.359
arrangement for regulation in case of our | 2135.68
country that body is CDSCO which looks | 2138.839
into the quality safety and efficacy of the | 2141.44
drugs both  Human and Veterinary and it has | 2144.52
a regulatory role in so far as the permission | 2148.16
for the import | 2151.119
manpower of any veterinary drug and human | 2154.0
drug and vaccine is required | 2156.39

G Force of the House Hon. | 2242.44
Member Depot That this NDA Government has no | 2246.16
data available Government does | 2248.119
not have data on the number of people who are | 2250.44
disabled who seek benefits from the | 2253.16
Ayushman Bharat Scheme Four to 5 on whether our | 2256.72
country has some disabilities through you I would like to know about the | 2259.92
Government  Has got any | 2262.48
special plans to make sure that every person with | 2264.96
disabilities has a | 2266.88
universal insurance scheme and whether they have any | 2269.96
plans on giving any support for those who have | 2272.839
care givers and whether they will pay for their | 2274.72
care givers | 
###
2278.079
first of all?  The data in | 2281.48
so far as our eligible beneficiary base is | 2284.96
concerned we are covering below 40 population | 2289.96
under this scheme and disability as per the | 2294.319
disability sir I would like to | 2297.48
first apply to the house through you and the rebel | 2300.8
member so we can talk about the beneficiary.  Base | 2304.24
of PM we are beneficiary from we | 2308.8
derive it from the SEC data we derive it | 2311.319
from the RSB BY AND we derive it | 2314.16
from NFSA sir under SEC data we have | 2318.599
a three criteria one is the automatic | 2322.0
allocation category second is the | 2332.599
provision for the  Disabled so that | 2336.24
criteria is disabled member and no able | 2339.16
bodied adult member so disabled members and | 2342.64
disabled person under sec have been | 2345.88
included in this PMJ scheme also | 2350.079
under NFSA we have a criterion under which the | 2353.56
Antyodaya other scheme household also | 2356.079
specifies that disability will be the | 2359.8
Common Inclusion Criteria for the | 2361.72
Identification of Priority Household | 2364.52
Disabled persons who are heading a household which has | 2367.839
no social support or an assured means | 2370.0
of subsistence and | 2373.2
disabled persons themselves who do not have a | 2376.96
social support and assured means of | 2379.079
subsistence are also included under | 2382.119
PMJ.  So disabled members are included | 2385.079
in different wages under these schemes but we | 2388.8
don't maintain a central repository of only the | 2392.4
disabled members but we have an overall | 2394.68
figure which reflects how many people we are | 2397.52
covering under this scheme also sir there are | 2400.359
13 states I would like to  Apriro Bal | 2403.0
Member There are 13 stay states which follow | 2405.839
Universal Health Coverage so every member with | 2409.0
in that state who is disabled is also | 2411.72
covered under the scheme and I would like to add that we have | 2415.359
a health benefit package under | 2418.4
PM J That package has been revised  five | 2421.2
times | 2445.359
Disabled person So we very much | 2448.079
take care of the disabled person by way of | 2450.839
PM Jaski but in different way | 
###
2454.04
Supplementary The question was going | 2457.68
to support care givers for disabled people The | 2459.92
minister did not answer that | 
###
2467.52
sir The question is about the care givers I | 2471.48
would like  To be very clear that Ayushman | 2473.56
Bharat takes care of the curative part not | 2477.119
the rehabilitative part so as for the care | 2479.839
givers are concerned and the NGOs are concerned they are | 2482.28
mostly in the area of | 2484.64

urban areas we have | 2592.24
depreciation | 2597.96
sir I don't want to go.  In to the details of | 2600.72

267 Honorable Minister 267  The statement | 2628.119
tabled on the Table of the House by the Hon'ble | 2631.599
Member I asked the Rebel Minister as he gave | 2637.64
negative answer for all the first to | 2640.2
queries about the illegal inclusion of Ava PV | 2643.8
Vaccine in the Evacuation Program then there is | 2646.88
further confusion between the Federal  States | 2649.24
of the Union and the Central Government You | 2652.079
have you have these number of letters coming | 2656.4
from the Government of Rajasthan to you | 2659.119
thanking you for including that and when I | 2661.92
get an answer set this is not a part of it | 2664.559
so there has to be an  Explanation to it | 2666.52
will you i kindly clear wether HVV | 2669.359
vaccine is a part of that we are not any other wise an | 2674.44
amount of 400 crores and given | 2679.04
to the state of Rajasthan for what we were | 2681.72
asking particular by way of communication | 2684.8
wether the logistics procurement program | 2687.319
Will be initiative | 
###
2693.72
like to make the members clear that on | 2697.319
HPV program concerns the status is like | 2701.88
this National Technical Advisory Group of India has | 2707.079
recommended for HPV vaccination by 2022 | 2711.72
but at the same time the government is having an | 2715.28
active consideration neither it nor  The | 2717.68
logistics issue we have to address is the number one | 2721.28
issue about the single dose and the double dose. | 2724.96
The indigenous vaccine is the double dose and | 2730.599
the vaccine which is being supported by an | 2733.28
external agency. The single dose number one is the issue we have. | 2737.079
To also see it the | 2740.76
capacity to roll out the program because one | 2744.88
we roll out the program as we said it | 2747.88
itself is the world largest program | 2750.24
and for that we have to see the capacity and | 2752.319
the logistics path that the government is | 2754.48
actively considering.  There are states have taken | 2757.24
initiative on their own part which we | 2759.76
accept and which we welcome also but as far | 2761.4
as the Government of India | 2763.76
is concerned it is under active consideration | 2766.079
and yes this needs to be rolled out and we are | 2769.48
actively considering active members  | 
###
2771.359
May I ask the NARAL Minister Sir | 2775.28
will you be allowing the state to do it on | 2778.04
their own and the states are under | 2780.44
restriction not to go about it till it is | 2783.2
decided at the Government of India level | 
###
2785.16
from the side we have not restricted | 2788.4
any state because  Sikkim is doing this | 2791.079
vaccination program Punjab did it for | 2794.28
year and half but didn't get the external | 2796.68
support and then they have stopped it So if the | 2799.2
states can do it on their own initiative we have | 2801.48
not stopped them but yes if we have to | 2804.4
Roll out it is a national program free of | 2807.359
cost for every buddy for every child and | 2810.28
for that the court logistics has to be developed | 2814.72
and that we are  |
