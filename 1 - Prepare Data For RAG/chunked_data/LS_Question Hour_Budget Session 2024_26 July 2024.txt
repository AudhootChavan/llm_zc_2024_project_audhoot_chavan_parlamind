Hon'ble Minister, Speaker | 124.159
Sir, Hon'ble | 128.239
Prime Minister through Mission Vatsalya  Mission Vatsalya Yojana, launched by our Government under the able leadership of Shri Ji, | 133.28
aims to ensure | 136.48
a healthy and happy childhood for every child of India by | 146.959
establishing a sensitive, supportive and contemporary eco-system for their complete development. | 149.959
And under | 153.8
this scheme, which has been created keeping in mind the goal of leaving no child behind, | 159.04
children trapped in difficult situations are given help and support | 162.48
and are | 164.92
connected to the main stream and | 170.4
for the overall development of children coming from different backgrounds.  Measures | 173.72
are taken: The government's thinking is that | 178.04
if any child has moved away from the main stream, then | 181.2
through our Mission Vatsalya, | 184.04
we provide all kinds of facilities to them | 187.48
so that the | 189.4
child can | 193.519
live in an institutional environment and do well.  So that it can be improved | 197.239
and from time to time, because | 202.92
we always send guidelines for this to the state government through the Government of India, we | 206.08
also conduct inspections from time to time | 208.68
so that the child and the child | 211.28
helpline we run for him through the child helpline. | 213.959
If there are children in distress due to any kind of | 216.519
problem, then | 219.159
they call the child helpline | 221.04
there and then special facilities are provided to them through our committees at the state level and then | 223.84
at the district level. | 
###
230.08
Sir According to various reports | 233.48
around 2 million children lost their | 236.159
parents due to Covid-19 Promoting | 240.319
the Government to lunch the PM Care for | 242.68
Children Scheme on May 29 2021 Ver s | 245.92
Government data shows only | 248.36
4532 children have been adopted Sir My | 251.36
question is where the in  Sensitive Government Has Done | 253.959
Any Study To Understand The Plight Of | 257.199
Children Who Have Lost Their Parents Due | 259.479
To Covid If Yes Shall Have Necessary Data To | 263.16
Help Us Understand What Exactly Happened | 265.72
To Two Million | 268.72
Children Mr. Speaker, I would like to | 271.56
convey this to the Honorable Member through you.  I want that under the | 275.039
PM Care Scheme, | 279.639
this facility was being provided to the children of parents who died of Covid | 282.28
and the exact time for this was from 29th May | 285.96
2021 to 11th March 2020 | 291.28
till 23rd and in this at the district level.  A committee has been formed | 296.84
under the leadership of DM and District Magistrate, | 298.96
there they apply | 302.0
and the children whose parents have | 304.6
died due to Covid are identified and | 307.44
given to them. | 310.84
Through this portal, many such people  Also | 313.12
applied in it, those children whose | 316.44
parents neither died nor | 319.199
faced any kind of problem during this period, | 321.56
all such children were registered in it due to | 324.44
which this list is visible, so this is the | 326.96
screening at the district level.  There is a committee and | 329.16
children are selected through the screening committee | 331.88
and under that we | 334.44
provide all kinds of facilities to the children which are given | 336.4
in the PM Care Fund and to the | 339.6
children whose parents died during Covid. | 342.479
So, | 347.759
we have provided all kinds of facilities to those who have come to that Kakaria. |

Malia Thank you | 358.08
Sir Ma Q to the Noble Minister of Mother and | 362.479
Child Development through US giving lot of | 365.44
children with special need in different | 367.24
child care madam.  In different child care | 370.319
institution, there is a specific plan for such | 373.52
children especially having severe special need. | 376.72
Thank you | 
###
386.0
sir, | 390.08
through Mission Vatsalya, we provide care to | 394.4
all the different types of children. | 397.56
CNCP is | 398.72
Baal Balgraha through which | 401.919
we provide care to the children.  And in that, like the | 405.96
children who need facilities, CWC, which is | 410.12
our committee at the district level, CWCs | 413.599
are DCPU and JJBs, then if | 417.0
any children require special facilities, | 419.08
then | 421.8
they inform the CWC in the CWC. | 425.72
And after that, CWC decides | 428.96
where to keep the children wherever they are needed | 431.24
because there are facilities for three types of our children, if there | 433.479
is a home then the children have to be | 439.759
kept either somewhere for institutional care or if there are children with special needs. | 442.12
All kinds of facilities have been made for them | 444.039
and the CWC looks after it. Accordingly, the | 446.56
CWC sends the children to that | 449.16
place to a | 450.039
safe place. | 452.12

Number 6 Yes Honorable Minister Question No. 6 Okay Honorable | 471.199
Minister Table  Off the House Honorable | 475.639
Member, Honorable Speaker, I would like to introduce myself to you in a minute. | 479.479
I am a | 481.0
first time MP. | 482.56
Honorable Speaker, you can introduce me in the chamber or | 486.36
ask a question. It will take a minute, | 489.919
sir. I am speaking for the first time. Introduction for a minute. | 492.8
I have come from the smallest house in the chamber. | 498.36
Question time has come from Gram Panchayat, Deputy Sarpanch. Ask question. In the chamber, | 500.639
everyone has become your boss. | 503.96
Thank you sir. I | 506.84
want to ask the honorable minister through you that sir, the | 509.759
revised average  Why have the | 512.68
country's small drug manufacturing | 515.479
companies been deprived of the Technological Upgradation Assistance Scheme, while the small | 518.2
drug manufacturing companies have told their problems to the government, | 520.24
but the government did | 522.68
not take any positive steps until the | 525.16
small companies of our country were provided this facility.  Till then we will not get the benefits of the scheme, | 529.44
how can we meet the global standards?  | 
###
535.56
Honorable Minister, I want to make the Honorable Member aware | 540.079
that the government has deprived everyone, be it a small company or a | 546.64
medium sized company.  The | 550.839
question of not only does not arise, but the | 553.6
work of encouraging them is | 555.76
done. The question is divided into two parts. The | 558.6
topic that comes in the first question is that by | 568.36
increasing the Pharmaceutical Technology Upgradation Assistance, the | 571.839
government led by Prime Minister Modi has | 573.88
revamped the farm.  Pharmaceuticals | 577.32
Technology Upgradation Assistant Scheme has been | 580.44
implemented and under this scheme, the objective of this scheme is to | 589.6
support our small industries and medium industries and give them special protection and the | 596.32
purpose of this | 599.88
is that | 600.839
according to the global standards which are | 603.88
WHO. | 612.44
How can we | 615.8
strengthen the pharmaceutical | 617.519
industry by taking our Good Manufacturing Practices together as per our standards, | 619.6
we are supporting for that and with a | 622.56
view to support, I am supporting the Hon.  I | 625.24
want to tell the member that | 638.88
we provide | 641.44
financial support to the manufacturing units which cost Rs 1 crore to Rs 500 crore and to strengthen them, | 646.839
such as those whose turnover is less than 1 crore.  Those whose turnover is between 50 crores to 50 | 649.8
crores, we support them at 20% | 655.2
financial support and not | 657.36
exceeding 10 crores, in the same way, those whose | 660.68
turnover is between 50 crores to 250 crores, | 664.639
we support them at 15% and that | 668.32
should also not be  Exceed is more than nine crores | 671.519
and the component is strengthening of the | 673.959
pharmaceutical industry for | 675.44
manufacturing and | 679.32
we provide financial support of Rs 10 crore to those whose turnover is Rs 250 to 500 crores, hence the | 687.8
question of depriving them does not arise, of encouraging them. | 692.959
This government is doing the work under the leadership of respected Prime Minister Modi Ji. | 
###
694.72
Honorable Member | 696.639
Supplementary | 699.2
Honorable Speaker, | 701.079
my second previous question through you is to the | 703.839
Honorable Minister that | 706.56
Honorable Member should not guide everyone to the small pharmaceutical | 709.8
company. It is very important to strengthen the pharmaceutical company so that | 711.8
Medicines for serious diseases which were available in our country | 715.56
in the times of Corona, we have seen the | 718.88
manner in which small companies are | 721.639
giving incentives to them, then the rates of their medicines are | 727.6
increasing today.  As for that, should the | 729.48
government fix something on the rate? Will the Minister tell from his side? | 
###
731.6
Honorable Minister, | 734.6
this question is not related to this question, | 737.76
but I would like to bring to his attention that | 739.76
we have two organizations, one | 742.72
under the Health Department and the National List of Essential. | 746.399
Medicines include essential medicines | 749.48
in which we add medicines whose | 752.36
price is capped and the | 755.48
price of their medicines is determined by the government, | 757.92
then we see them in the National List of Essential Medicines | 760.839
and in the same way a | 764.32
pharmaceutical  There is NPPA in the department of medicine | 768.44
which is the authority for pricing, so it is | 771.399
also the authority for the price of the essential | 774.72
medicines and other wise also the pricing of the | 779.16
drugs which are not included in the schedule is | 781.24
also done, hence I am | 784.04
here in the house to all the members of the House.  I | 786.199
want to make the members aware that the government controls the price of all the deadly | 789.079
diseases and life saving medicines | 796.88
and takes | 800.12
care of the common man to be able to buy them. | 803.56
Honorable Minister, let me inform you | 807.6
that  There is a demand for Indian medicines in all the countries of the world that I have | 810.72
visited. I am | 817.079
satisfied with their quality and rates. | 
###
822.44
Arvind Sawan | 825.079
ji, thank you noble speaker, Galol can make it global | 828.44
and expand it. It means a lot what he | 831.12
says.  Thank you, Narel Speaker, one | 835.0
minute, Arvind ji. The opinion of all of them in the House is | 839.199
that we can increase it | 841.839
globally and | 845.04
India can also become the number one country in the world in exporting. Like | 848.04
this, I will give it to you also Arvind Sawan ji. | 851.0
Thank you Speaker Speaker Sir while | 854.079
giving an answer to the question made some slub, | 857.32
do we want to help like this? From zero to | 860.24
50 crores to 1 crore to 50 crores. | 862.72
In the same answer you said to the extent of | 865.6
9 crores when what till 250 crores.  If you are going to pay Rs 15, then why Rs 1 | 869.519
crore? If you | 872.279
earn more on Rs 15, then what is the limit you have | 874.279
imposed? Does the percentage matter? | 876.839
Secondly, you have received the maximum number of | 879.839
applications. You have approved only seven of them. | 883.759
The 93 were rejected | 887.639
and will be considered in future and | 890.279
secondly, I welcome whatever efforts you make. It is | 893.32
very good that what the Respected | 897.44
Speaker said, | 900.44
when we are going to create a world class patent for our medicines, | 902.88
then we  Have to create pattern | 904.72
also, if our Indian pharmaceutical | 907.24
companies try to create our patent, does the | 909.92
government help them or | 912.399
not and efforts are being made or not? Thank you, | 
###
914.24
Honorable Minister, | 916.519
Honorable Speaker, first of all, | 919.399
I agree with what you said.  Let me add that | 922.279
as far as India is concerned in making medicines, today the world | 925.44
accepts that India has become the dispensary of the world, the | 932.16
world's most effective and the | 935.16
most cheapest medicine and India | 937.959
is producing it. I want to share this with all the members of the House. | 940.279
I want this and the Government of India is | 942.56
encouraging it. As far as you | 946.959
said that this is a scheme of one crore rupees, the | 954.56
purpose of this scheme is to support the small industries which are in the Rs | 957.56
250 to 50 category. | 960.0
But they are doing it in that proportion that | 962.8
we will give 20% to small, we will give 15% | 966.839
to middle and yes and that is the advancing level, | 970.279
your suggestion is fine, you | 973.959
can keep it as a member and you can | 977.16
send it to me in the letter.  Give schemes are always | 980.079
on going and there is always | 982.24
situation where we can think of some | 984.839
modification | 986.6
and patent, as far as you have | 989.36
said is ok, we will try to encourage it in this way also | 992.519
and what | 995.12
you said about seven approved  It is also an | 997.639
on going process, 100 applications have been | 999.92
registered and seven of them have been | 1002.639
approved.  | 
###
1006.759
Gaurav Gog ji, Chairman, I want to express my gratitude to you | 1009.56
and when it comes to quality, | 1012.519
I want to know from the government that the | 1016.079
drugs which are being imported from here to India.  What is the government's criteria regarding the quality of the medicine that we send from India to other states | 1022.399
because there has | 1025.12
also been news that | 1027.959
many people have expressed concern about the cough medicine that has gone to Africa. | 1034.36
Wrong substances have been found, perhaps the government has | 1038.28
also taken some steps, then there is | 1041.16
news regarding the quality of cough medicines, | 1044.0
what is the government doing beyond this, I | 1045.76
would like to know from the Minister, Honorable Minister, like | 1048.36
our very rob system | 1052.48
of  Ajam Examination is for the medicines which are | 1057.2
exported, their sample | 1059.799
survey is also done here and when that consignment | 1063.08
goes there, they have a random | 1065.559
survey there, which they have | 1068.36
said about Khasi, at one time the Government of India had come on that.  We have | 1071.64
also taken action and we are constantly | 1076.799
keeping a vigil on this and are paying attention to it so that such | 1081.12
incidents do not happen again. | 
###
1084.08
Sogata Roy | 1087.679
ji, Honorable | 1090.12
Minister has told | 1095.64
what steps are being taken to raise the standards of our pharmaceutical industry. | 1097.88
Honorable member Gaurav Gogoi | 1102.36
said that there is a | 1106.08
serious plan regarding our drug exports and till now no | 1117.039
legitimate steps have been taken to improve it. Tell me your suggestion. | 1121.24
Come on sir, no suggestion, no suggestion. My question is that | 1125.28
in the minister's office.  Also, there are | 1129.44
institutions like Bengal Chemical IDPL, they are dying, | 1135.24
their condition is very bad, | 1139.32
what steps is the Minister taking to improve them and raise their standards. | 
###
1144.24
See, Honorable Speaker, this question is | 1148.08
related to the | 1152.0
under the Pharmaceutical Upgradation Assistant Scheme.  But | 1154.44
we replied that the honorable member has a | 1157.24
specific question and he is | 1160.039
discussing about the specific unit. The | 1161.88
honorable member should write to me and | 1165.159
I will answer it in depth and | 1168.72
also answer | 1172.08
it because this is the question. Not related to |

Mohd Bashir ji, thank you very much sir. Sir, | 1516.36
my question is related to the functioning | 1519.24
of this fund in different | 1520.919
and sir transparency, accountability and | 1526.679
structured.  Feedback Mainim I'm missing it | 1531.039
Totally confusing sir in fear to subt my | 1534.88
point I'd like to quote Parliament | 1537.279
Standing Committee on Axial Affairs in the 15 | 1540.039
report highlighted the need for improved | 1542.52
transparency and accountability in the | 1544.64
management of | 1546.12
ID The report's aim is whilst IC is Duff  Been | 1552.159
Beneficial to the Needy People Some More Attention | 1556.2
in this It amounts setting up of a | 1559.2
transparent mechanism for monitoring and | 1562.279
evaluating the fund utilization ensuring | 1565.64
that the support reaches the intended | 1568.0
beneficiary Sir I would like to ask the | 1570.48
Minister OK but he will also agree | 1573.279
Because given that such details are in 137, | 1576.799
your good suggestion. Hello question | 1578.32
sir, what | 1581.88
type of mechanism is going to be | 1583.76
introduced to assure transparency in the | 1586.48
system. | 1590.559
Sir, the honorable member is a very senior member | 1594.32
of the House and he  Constantly raise the issue | 1598.2
of safety, security and well being of | 1601.76
workers | 1603.039
abroad so we have tried to give a very detailed | 1606.2
reply and specifically to the questionable | 1608.799
member's question regarding transparency. | 1611.559
Transparency measures should be built in so that | 1613.96
this fund is constantly | 1615.84
monitored.  By mission abroad so it is | 1618.76
largely collected by living charges on | 1621.48
consular services so it is a global fund | 1624.679
and even mission needs more it is transferred | 1627.08
there and we have since 2014 sir we have | 1633.0
spent Rs 656 crore to s more than 3.5 | 1637.12
lakh in India dist  Sir Sir, | 1639.919
our current balance as on date is Rs. 692 crores but even then | 1642.6
Sir we are welcome to take any suggestion | 1644.96
from the rebel member to increase the vehicle | 1649.52
currency of the | 1651.72

1661.279
Deepender Hooda | 1663.919
ji, I would like to know through you, whether the | 1668.12
Ministry of External Affairs is aware of the fact | 1672.279
that in the last few years, sir, a large | 1676.279
number of | 1679.919
youth from many states of our country have migrated through risky routes without visas.  It is | 1683.519
called Donkey's path. Due to unemployment and frustration, people are | 1686.96
moving to foreign countries. US is the only one. | 1689.279
I give the example of US. According to Custom and | 1691.559
Border Patrol CBP US, | 1696.12
97000 Indian citizens are traveling through | 1700.64
Mexico border through the jungles of Panama | 1702.679
or through Canada. | 1705.159
In the last one year inside the US, they have checked them. The | 1711.6
youth go through inhuman conditions. Today | 1714.039
in the US alone, there are 15 lakh Indian citizens | 1717.559
who are undocumented. Is the | 1720.32
Ministry of External Affairs aware of the problems they face?  Is he | 1723.32
sensitive about it? | 1725.679
If yes then what is he doing to help them |

immigration check is not required sir our | 1753.76
government has started an e migrate portal | 1756.559
Sir, the reason for this is that | 1760.159

register on it, when they go out, their data | 1765.48

Honorable Statement Led on Table of House Honorable | 1855.399
Member | 1858.12
Speaker | 1859.24
Sir, today the serious disease which is | 1862.24
spreading rapidly in the country, the number of cancer patients, the | 1865.96
poor and middle class | 1869.48
people are rapidly falling prey to it, the expensive medicines, the | 1873.12
deaths due to not getting timely treatment, the | 1874.88
matter of concern, I told the Minister about cancer. | 1880.36
Asked a question regarding making medicines available to the patients at lower prices, the | 1882.639
minister replied to this, Mr. Speaker, I | 1886.159
can ask two or two, sir, first ask one, | 1888.639
you ask one question first, | 1890.559
you ask the question, | 1893.76
instead of the one you would have written.  In reply, it was said that on NPPA 272 | 1897.36
2019, there was a | 1901.32
maximum limit of 30% trade margin on non-scheduled anti-cancer drugs, which led to an | 1908.88
average reduction of 50% in the MRP of 526 brands of medicines. Minister, on the | 1912.72
list given by you in the reply, | 1915.639
on Karma No. 118.  The MRP of the medicine which is trace to answer is Rs | 1919.48
54,725 but its price is | 1924.639
Rs 13,000 to 14,000. In such a situation, the corporate | 1928.24
hospitals charge the full MRP from the patients. | 1930.76
Do you want to | 1932.679
issue any instructions to mention the MRP as per the actual price so | 1934.96
that  Patients should not be cheated. | 1938.159
If yes then for how long. If not then why. | 1941.159
Minister, this table was an example. Minister, such things are | 1943.84
happening inside many medicines. Honorable Minister, | 
###
1946.84
Honorable Speaker, the question asked by the Honorable Member is | 1952.76
true as far as cancer is concerned.  This is | 1958.2
continuously increasing and the number of | 1961.84
cancer patients is increasing by about two and a half percent every year | 1966.159
and in that too, | 1969.84
most of the breast cancer is in women and oral | 1973.519
cancer and lung cancer are | 1976.88
increasing in men. The number of patients is more than 155 lakh. | 1984.76
Regarding the medicines which are being registered, he said that | 1988.679
we have a list which | 1991.559
we monitor and overall, as | 1996.0
I said in the first question, there are | 2001.799
131 medicines for cancer in the National List of Essential Medicines, 131 which are in Schedule One.  This is the | 2006.159
pricing which is done by the government | 2009.32
and done by NPPA and this is the medicine | 2012.519
which is most commonly used and which is being used | 2015.399
and on this the NPPA | 2018.6
imposes ceiling prices, through this | 2022.48
about | 2023.44
Rs 294 crore is given to the patients.  We have benefited | 2026.399
from imposing this ceiling and we have | 2030.0
also tried to take it forward in this manner. | 2032.679
Apart from this, we have | 2037.44
some medicines which do not come in the list of 131 | 2043.84
but there are 28 such combinations which can be fixed.  They | 2050.8
do not come in the market, but | 2053.76
regarding that also, the government and NPPA have | 2057.0
controlled their pricing and | 2060.399
as far as the cost is concerned, the MRP cannot be more than 30% of the level which | 2064.24
reaches the distributor. | 2070.639
And this is also being reduced from Rs. 50, that is, the | 2074.32
price has been reduced from Rs. 50. Efforts have been made in such a way | 2077.56
that | 2080.8
we can make cancer drugs at affordable prices. | 2083.8
We paid special attention to two things: one, | 2086.639
this  In these Jan Aushadhi | 2090.04
Kendras, we have approximately | 2094.52
1300 outlets, out of the approximately 2000 medicines we provide in those 13000 outlets, | 2101.24
83 medicines are anti-cancer and wherever | 2104.76
we try to give medicines, the | 2107.599
same  In this way, our Affordable Medicine and | 2111.119
Reliable Implant Treatment Amrit | 2114.2
scheme is also run which | 2117.56
we have opened its outlet in every government hospital and where | 2120.4
we also try to provide branded medicines to the patients at low rates, | 2123.8
then in | 2126.359
this way cancer can be cured.  We have tried to | 2130.04
keep it under control and in the | 2132.839
budget presented by our honorable sister | 2137.16
Sitharaman ji the day before yesterday, | 2139.48
customs duty on three cancer drugs has been | 2142.16
removed so that | 2145.04
we can get them at a cheaper price.  So, in the | 2149.079
question that the honorable member has asked, he has | 2153.28
asked about a particular person, he has said that | 2156.359
I will definitely examine it, this is the | 2158.8
number you have mentioned, | 2162.319
but I will examine that if it is | 2164.48
from the MRP.  If it is going ahead then the local | 2167.64
authorities will take care of it but | 2176.8
it is our responsibility that no medicine will be sold anywhere above the ceiling prices fixed by NPPA. | 
###
2179.92
Honorable | 2181.64
Member, Speaker, | 2184.28
Sir, Minister, on NPPA | 2188.28
272 2019.  A | 2191.92
maximum limit of 30% trade margin has been | 2194.079
fixed on non-scheduled anti-cancer drugs, but the | 2199.599
pharma | 2202.2
companies have started selling the medicines at arbitrary rates by adding extra salt to the medicines which are scheduled under these rules. | 2205.48
In such a situation, they have violated your notification to violate your notification. | 2210.079
In such a situation, will you bring | 2212.76
any policy to curb the work being done by the pharma companies? | 2215.44
If yes, by when, if not, why, | 2218.24
details along with the reasons, Minister of the whole House, | 2220.92
Sir, lastly, my head, along with this, whether | 2225.68
when within the budget?  You are telling that | 2227.56
we have done so much for cancer, then does the government at its | 2230.56
level have the idea of ​​providing completely free medicines to cancer patients in the hospitals of all the medical colleges of the country and | 2236.68
in the government institutions? | 2241.56
What does the government say about this?  I want | 2243.64
you to tell me these details, | 
###
2245.8
not the Minister, where he said that they | 2249.119
add salt or comminution to some medicines, I | 2251.16
replied to him that look, this is a regular | 2254.04
process, when | 2257.079
we make it mandatory that we put a ceiling on 40 medicines, | 2260.319
then they come out with a new medicine.  In | 2263.4
which we change the composition a little | 2265.48
and they go out of the ceiling, for this we have | 2267.0
regular | 2269.319
monitoring and that is why we said that there are | 2272.079
28 such formulations which do | 2276.8
not come in the fixed composition | 2278.0
and they do not come in the ceiling but these | 2279.92
We have also included it, so this is a | 2281.92
regular process. Whenever any medicine of this type | 2284.4
comes in the market, our effort is to | 2291.68
put a ceiling on any cancer drug that comes and is not affordable. | 2294.28
NPPA, which regulates our pricing.  Authority | 2296.56
is there, it is effective and it tries to bring | 2299.56
it to the ceiling by using it and taking action on it. |

as we all know that cancer is a | 2328.76
very serious disease.  It is a terrible disease and we | 2334.88
all sitting here also know that in the last two | 2338.119
months, we were elected on 4th June and I | 2342.2
feel that in the last two and a quarter months of being a Member of Parliament, | 2344.4
I have | 2347.28
signed the maximum number of letters from cancer patients. | 2351.44
Prime Minister, what is your question for Lee Fund? | 2354.56
My question is this, I | 2357.359
want to ask through you that no one has been able to escape from this, it is a | 2360.64
very dangerous disease. Can this | 2364.52
happen where we say that | 2367.56
India has become the world's fastest growing economy?  It | 2371.44
is going to be made and even today below | 2374.76
poverty line people are | 2378.48
pushing here to get cancer treatment, someone is | 2380.72
pushing there, someone is getting us to sign, | 2382.72
can this happen in this country that | 2386.24
those suffering from cancer  There are people below the poverty | 2389.52
line, they are middle class people, their treatment should be | 2392.0
free, why should medicines be made cheap, | 2394.4
I want to ask the Minister through you, | 2396.88
Honorable Minister, it can be done, okay, | 
###
2404.76
I appreciate the feeling of the Honorable Member. | 2408.2
In fact, cancer is a fatal | 2412.52
disease and the | 2415.4
condition of the family that suffers from it gets worsened in a way, | 2418.2
but the | 2421.599
government led by our Prime Minister has | 2423.4
taken many steps for this and | 2426.119
with a view to take steps | 2428.44
Since the establishment of cancer care units, annual assistance of Rs | 2432.72
5 lakh has been provided to 50 crore people and 10 crore 34 lakh families in Ayushman Bharat, | 2444.68
and an | 2449.24
effort has been made to include the poor people in this | 2453.72
so that cancer can be treated. | 2457.52
Similarly, many cancer procedures are | 2461.079
also free for BPL people, | 2463.4
but the | 2466.76
free diagnostic facility we have | 2469.04
provided at many places, right from PHC to tertiary | 2471.8
care units, includes these  All things are taken | 2474.68
care of. I also want to tell here | 2477.359
that we are | 2479.88
working on three things. Firstly, a | 2485.4
lot of work is going on on preventive, promotional and curative prevention | 2487.8
because it should be promoted and promotional | 2492.119
so that we can improve health.  Now many people | 2495.64
say a lot about us while promoting, but you must have seen | 2498.8
that we have tried to tell about the impact of cancer by labeling every tobacco, in the | 2505.16
same way we have | 2508.359
also tried to tell about the impact of tobacco. | 2515.52
As far as curative is concerned, our | 2518.599
effort is to make cancer patients affordable | 2522.76
and | 2524.2
accessible and make arrangements for their treatment | 2528.16
and on this, the government | 2530.56
Efforts are being made |

Sambhavhi Thanks Speaker Sir, first of all | 2544.4
I would like to thank the government that | 2549.48
by exempting the custom duty on three cancer drugs, they have made cancer treatment | 2551.92
more affordable. My question | 2555.76
is about Carti Cell Therapy which is a cancer treatment.  It is | 2559.319
an affordable medium for treatment | 2561.599
but currently it is available in only 30 hospitals across the country. | 2563.8
My question to the Honorable | 2566.359
Minister is that | 2573.72
when will it start in rural and backward areas to make cancer treatment more affordable through CARTI cell therapy?  So that poor | 2576.52
families can get its benefit, | 2579.48
this facility has to be expanded. Due | 2582.96
course, we will expand it as it happens. We will | 2585.88
talk on the demand of the grand. |

###
3391.599
so Shri Praniti.  Shinde, to | 3395.52
ask briefly, it's 12 o'clock, there are | 3404.359
many PHCs | 3408.039
in our country in Maharashtra which are still equipped except | 3410.799
ultrasound, there is no other machinery in | 3413.96
Pech and law of people, come to the main civil | 3417.2

They have to come to the civil hospital even to get a pay for example disability certificate or to | 3424.559
get a simple ECG, | 3426.96
they have to come to the civil hospital, | 3429.4
then NAREL Minister I would like to ask you | 3431.68
through Speaker sir and there are no paid doctors here either. | 3434.24
Many a times, those who | 3436.24
have the responsibility live there. So are | 3438.44
you going to equip all the PHCs in our | 3440.48
country with ECG machines with more | 3442.76
ultrasound machines. Have a disability | 3444.799
center which is Swavlamban, that too is | 3448.28
not running for the last three months. Are you | 3451.16

Minister. Time is 12 o'clock. Let me tell you in very short | 3457.359
that the arrangement we have made is in | 3461.119
such a way that in all the centers we | 3465.319

till the district level. You | 3502.68
all will be happy to know that our | 3505.4
