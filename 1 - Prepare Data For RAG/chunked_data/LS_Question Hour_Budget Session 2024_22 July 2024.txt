Om | 2.879
Shanti Question Hour Question Number One Shri | 7.56
Rahul | 9.48
Kaswa I look here now | 13.92
Question | 18.48
Number Honorable Minister | 25.279
Honorable Member Thank you Speaker Sir | 30.679
Speaker Sir the | 35.0
first Kendriya Vidyalaya school was opened in the country on 15th December 1963, | 38.0
after that till date in the country | 40.559
About 1253 schools have been opened in India. If I talk about the past few | 44.36
years as per the answer of the Minister, | 46.48
then 48 schools have been newly opened, out of | 50.28
which Rajasthan state has got only two | 52.239
schools. The | 54.359
speed with which schools have opened in the last 56 years is | 57.6
about 22 schools per year.  Years kept opening | 60.44
and in the past few years, only two schools were | 62.96
opened every year, the speed was very | 65.84
low and the guidelines that were made were | 69.28
made according to the guidelines of 1963. Today's | 72.68
times are changing and your | 76.119
government is Amrit Cities.  Name is developing big cities | 79.64
whose population is above one lakh. | 81.28
Sir, I | 84.2
want to know through you, Minister, whether the | 86.52
government will bring changes in its policy and will | 89.119
bring schools which have population above one lakh. | 92.84
Which are the cities like | 95.759
Sujangarh city of our Lok Sabha constituency which has a | 97.6
population of more than one lakh, do you | 104.119
make any provision for opening such schools in such cities after bringing changes in your policy? | 
###
107.24
Honorable Speaker Sir, Honorable Member asked the | 111.079
question.  Have asked and I can understand that it is natural that | 116.6
considering the credibility of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, all the MPs want it to be | 120.28
expanded in their areas. | 124.92
1253 Kendriya Vidyalayas have been opened in the entire country and | 129.64
in the last 6 years, no matter the academic performance,  If | 132.48
you look at the standard, it is | 134.84
surpassing other institutions. The | 137.599
honorable member has asked a question regarding Rajasthan | 140.64
and in the main question regarding Sujangarh, | 142.76
he asked that no proposal has been presented to us regarding Sujangarh yet | 145.36
and it has | 148.4
an old process. | 
###
152.239
Honorable | 153.92
Member Minister Sir, I have asked the same thing | 156.879
whether you will try to change the policy on us | 159.2
because as of today, | 161.92
where the school is in a far away place, today my | 163.44
Kendriya Vidyalaya is in Churu. | 165.4
Sujangarh is at a distance of 150 kilometers from it | 167.48
and we want athletes at every point to | 169.84
target the Amrit cities | 171.879
where the population is above 1 lakh and | 173.64
you will also give priority to Sujangarh. | 175.92
Similarly, whatever you have done in your  In the answer it was | 177.64
told that 12 schools of the Central Institute of Higher | 179.239
Learning were opened | 181.56
across the country and Rajasthan did | 183.36
not get even a single school in it. It is definitely a good | 185.28
concept but with this concept | 187.159
Rajasthan has been deprived.  I | 189.28
would like to start this with Su Jangar, my | 191.72
question to you would be, Speaker sir, as  | 
###
194.959
I just said, there is a process and under that policy the | 198.239
decision of Kendriya Vidyalaya is taken, there are | 200.44
some standards for it, first of all | 203.319
we should receive the proposal, it should be done by the state | 205.76
government.  The | 208.08
Ministries and Departments of the Government can establish it. | 210.879
Along with this, Kendriya Vidyalayas are also constructed in the project mode. The | 213.04
12 | 216.72
Kendriya Vidyalayas which the Honorable Member is mentioning are | 218.879
also constructed in the project mode. | 220.439
Rajasthan has been the priority of our government | 223.799
and will continue to be so. | 226.4
On behalf of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, we continuously work on the maintenance of our institutions and | 229.879
their arrangements. The | 235.68
main provision in our policy is that according to which the | 238.519
center will be established, | 240.28
first a proposal should come, land | 243.0
should be allotted and  There should also be the facility of temporary accommodation, only | 245.92
after that we | 248.079
can move ahead and there should also be central employees. | 251.319
I want to request the honorable members. | 254.879
This is the first day of the question hour. | 260.04
Honorable members should also ask brief questions. | 262.4
Honorable Minister should also be brief.  If you | 264.32
answer then we can take more questions. | 267.6
This is my request, Shri Govind | 273.6
Kajol will give adequate opportunity to all the valid members who come for the first time. | 276.639
I have | 280.0
told Kani Moji ji that I have also requested the senior members to | 284.96
come after being elected for the first time.  My request is to give priority to those in the Question Hour | 287.68
whom the House will | 290.84
accept. Go | 
###
293.8
Govind, now | 298.199
Govind and | 300.16
Speaker Sir, my question number one is to | 304.28
Education | 310.72
Minister, you should ask the question, | 314.919
Sarbal Speaker, Sir, my Parliament, Kansi | 319.319
Chitradurga, I am the most backward in the country | 323.759
and Moran, population is 52 per cent.  To SC | 330.199
and Dogla community they are very poor families | 335.0
and their children are not getting quality | 339.68
education so I request the Government to kindly instruct | 343.319
the Compt Authority to give immediate | 348.039
approval | 
###
353.56
Mr. Speaker, I do not see the question. A demand has been | 357.72
raised and I inform the Honorable Member.  I would | 360.759
also like to say that his proposal is | 363.6
currently being considered and is being examined at many levels. | 366.16

Nk Pram Aap Question Prn Ji Sir P | 910.639
Sir The Basic Issue Before | 914.199
Us The Credibility Of  The comp examination list has been limited by | 918.04
24 lakh students up for | 922.6
the new UG examination this time the corruption has | 925.88
started from date of registration | 929.759
now this time the registration date has been | 932.319
extended and for correcting the Aadhaar | 934.88
updation that has also been extended and the leakage | 937.6
of  Paper also happened in Patna and | 940.759
after all these things now the future of the | 943.199

###
1032.16
Akhilesh Yadav ji, I will answer everything in a minute. | 1035.6
Today let's sit, Speaker Sir, I | 1039.039
want to thank you, | 1042.88
you have given me time to ask on a very important question of the country. | 1046.72
Speaker Sir, the government should not make anyone else's | 1050.12
record, but the record of paper league is | 1053.799
important. The government will make it. Speaker | 1057.039
Sir, I do not want to go into its background. | 1060.6
Speaker Sir, I do | 1062.88
not want to go into the background of when, how and | 1064.72
which institution was created. | 1066.799
Students from all over the country.  They were | 1072.28
continuously agitating on this issue, things are coming to light after the investigation by newspapers and CBI, | 1075.6
people are being caught, they are being | 1077.679
sent to jail. | 1080.44
I want to ask the Minister through you, Mr. Speaker, | 1086.039
what are the children who have | 1091.08
got the highest marks center wise?  We will release its list. There are | 1094.48
300 seats where there are many centres. | 1098.84
Speaker, there are such places where 2000 children have | 1102.52
passed. The government seats are 300. | 1106.6
In many centres, more than 2000 have passed. OK, there are | 1109.08
places in many states where | 1111.799
600 to 650 students have passed from some centres.  The | 1115.32
highest number is more than 1000. OK and if that institution was so | 1120.84
credible, then Mr. Chairman, | 1126.799
what was the infrastructure of the centers where this examination was conducted? Did the Minister give | 1128.72
information about this? OK Chairman, | 1131.84
Chairman, I have only one request through you.  Is it | 1133.919
that without this minister, | 1137.559
justice will not be given to the children?  | 
###
1140.6
Yes, President, Sir, I | 1144.76
would like to humbly answer the question of respected Akhilesh ji that | 1147.76
just now the case is going on in the Supreme Court. The | 1151.36
Supreme Court has ordered to upload the complete | 1154.2
list of students on the website. | 1157.28
Sir, please provide the list of all the students across the country since last three days, it is | 1162.919
available in the public domain, this whole thing is in the open | 1166.2
and many types of arguments have come up, Sir, | 1170.24
I have just now done good in it, have the students of Kerala | 1175.2
also done well?  We will also say that there was | 1177.48
something wrong there too, to make such allegations, the | 1180.799
rural areas of the country, the ST SCs of the country, this | 1184.72
time the best performing | 1187.36
ST SCs of the country are from rural background and economically | 1190.12
backward people, do we challenge their flour | 1192.799
and the rest? | 1195.679
I am the head of the league on wrestling, again my stand from the beginning has been | 1198.72
not to do politics, but | 1201.24
when Akhilesh ji was in charge there that morning, | 1203.559
sir, the whole list is how many times | 1206.44
question papers have been leaked in Uttar Pradesh, |

my education, my values, | 1342.36
my social life, I have got the | 1345.88
approval of the people of my state, | 1349.0
I am someone's certificate of my intellectuality and my | 1351.48
values, I have the essence.  There is | 1353.679
no need from anyone in the House. In the democracy of the country, | 1356.12
in the democracy of the country, my | 1359.039
leader Prime Minister Modi ji has been | 1360.6
elected as the Prime Minister and I | 1363.36
am leaving him here with his decision. The | 1366.039
rest is to tell the House that the truth will not become a lie by shouting, | 1370.96
sir.  Sir, whatever has been said about the | 1374.76
present examination system of the country, | 1380.039
Sir, nothing can be a stronger statement than this from the leader of the | 1383.919
opposition. Sir, I | 1386.799
condemn it with the slightest word, the rest remains, Sir, | 1390.32
through you, Sir, I would like to | 1394.0
present a fact before the country.  I am sir, who has | 1397.919
run the government remotely. In 2010, three bills were brought. | 1406.08
Respected leader of his party, Kapil Sil, had brought three bills for the reform of education. | 1409.88
One of them was | 1412.799
education bill and one of them was Prohibition of | 1416.88
Unfair Practices Bill 2010, the purpose of which was | 1423.919
Sir, my government has the courage to stop malpractice in education institutions. | 1427.32
Just now we have | 1429.799
brought bills and made laws regarding the regularity of public examination. What was the compulsion of the | 1433.08
Congress Party? What was the compulsion of the | 1436.12
Leader of the Opposition? He used that force under | 1439.96
whose control was he? What was his personal interest?  Under the | 1444.36
pressure of the private medical college and their | 1448.6
bribery, he had passed that bill. The | 1451.52
truth is in front of everyone. I do | 1456.0
not question anyone's scholarship, | 1457.919
but the truth is that in 2010, his own government had brought the education reform bill | 1462.039
in medicine. | 1464.84
They ask us questions | 
###
1469.76
one | 1470.559
minute one minute please one minute please I will give | 1474.64
everyone a chance one minute | 1478.08
one minute one minute honorable member please please sit for | 1481.44
a minute | 1483.08
no please sit for the first time you are for the first | 1489.08
time one | 1491.04
[appreciation] | 1496.52

please Kalyan | 1501.79
[Music] | 1503.52
Ji Kalyan | 1505.15
[Music] | 1509.24
Ji Kalyan Ji please Kalyan please please one | 1513.88
minute please one minute one minute I will give everyone a chance | 1517.36
one minute | 1518.6
please | 1520.279
erase Honorable | 1523.039
members, the topic was important, I bonfire everyone | 1528.679
but once | 1532.36
this meaningful discussion takes place inside this House. | 1537.48
Because the | 1539.279
question was that within the subject of examinations | 1542.399
and you all know that in different | 1546.559
states of the country, there were governments of different parties | 1550.0
and in the governments of those different parties, you also had | 1553.32
governments and other parties also had governments there. | 1557.24
Many times questions were leaked, question papers were leaked | 1559.96
and questions were raised on the examinations. My questions are for | 1563.76
one minute. I am telling you, | 1566.399
listen to me completely. My point is that we and | 1571.52
those secrets, please sit for a minute, please sit for | 1575.559
a minute, not all, not all, ours, ours.  The question | 1579.84
is that we are sitting here to worry | 1581.919
that no | 1586.48
issue should be raised about the future of our students, | 1588.88
hence what kind of mechanism should be developed, | 1592.159
what better system of examinations should be developed and | 1594.36
everyone's suggestions should come in it so that the future can be improved | 1598.08
within and for them.  There may be good suggestions, the | 1600.76
government will also accept that good suggestion for a | 1605.0
minute, but if we | 1608.679
raise questions on all the examinations, then | 1613.08
in many states there are governments of many parties which keep | 1615.48
conducting examinations. If we | 1618.799
raise questions on all the examinations, then the children who | 1621.48
pass.  There will be a very serious impact on their future and | 1624.799
on the examinations of India, on the educational systems of India | 1627.08
all over the world, | 1629.64
which is a matter of concern of the House | 1632.76
and for this, all the states have | 1636.36
made laws in their respective places, Parliament has also made laws, | 1640.24
apart from making laws, this  The | 1644.08
agency is investigating within the subject, the court is monitoring, | 1646.919
our question should be how can we | 1653.799
improve this system by giving positive suggestions, it should be that the | 1656.44
House is not based on allegations and counter allegations, you should | 1659.0
develop a better system and at any time  It is not appropriate | 1663.36
for the House to ever raise questions on all the examinations. | 1667.12
This House is not meant for this. There is no | 1669.88
platform, no question number. | 1674.24
Shri D Prasad Rao, | 1680.36
everyone is allowed to raise questions during the question hour and | 1684.24
once the question is raised, it is not raised again. | 1687.44
Parliament runs on rules and procedures and | 1691.96
I run it on rules and procedures. | 1693.72
Mr. D. Prasad | 1696.32
Rao Question number three: | 1701.6
No, I have | 1704.0
conveyed the concerns of the House to the Government and have also conveyed to all of you. |

centrally sponsored schemes are for all the states | 1854.12

important from the point of view | 2552.559
of the first lady member who asked this | 2554.88

most | 2617.44
important list of 6 major | 2622.72
offenses is not spoken while the Honorable Member is sitting and is | 2626.76
not | 2629.2
given a tip. Okay, Honorable Minister, so | 2633.559
63 offenses have been | 2637.16
done.  Criminalize and as a result | 2640.599
of such companies today are able to carry on the | 2645.4
function without the worry of | 2647.72
compliance where there was a central processing | 2650.2
center which has been set up so that specified | 2653.119
non STP e reforms can also e | 2655.72
forms related questions can also be | 2657.64
taken up.  So the most important part | 2660.44
of this is zero fee for incorporation has been | 2664.0
brought in for companies with authorized cap of Rs 15 | 2668.04
up to Rs 15 lakh meaning small companies which | 2671.28
have small capitals with which they start the | 2673.52
business there is no fee charged as such. | 2677.64

Settlement Of Claims Is A Remarkable Step | 2719.76
Taken  Forward and our markets have also | 2722.04
been and companies have also benefited from | 2724.28
it in fact we are far ahead of very many other | 2727.64
countries where companies law | 2730.68
similar company laws operate they are still not | 2734.2
able to settle claims even if | 2740.16
TPF and TPF  We even come to be | 2743.48

3055.64
Honorable Speaker | 3058.44
Sir, the question that the honorable member has asked is | 3062.24
definitely very important and | 3074.2
throws light on an important topic like education which is related to the life of the society and the words of the individual which is related to life, | 3078.119
but we all  Let us know that as per the | 3082.079
Seventh Schedule of the Constitution on Library Edge, | 3084.52
it is a State subject | 3087.559
and being a State subject, the | 3089.48
primary | 3091.24
responsibility is to | 3093.4
connect people with the library, to | 3099.2
increase people's ability to study, this responsibility is  The | 3102.319
responsibility of creating awareness lies with the state governments. The | 3104.44
Government of India, through the National Mission of | 3107.96
Library, provides funds and resources to the states to | 3111.72
supplement their efforts. | 3114.48
Honorable Chairman, | 3117.64
Sir, I would like to inform the Honorable Member and the House through you. | 3120.24
That | 3125.68
along with enhancing the physical infrastructure of libraries, they can also enhance the library experience at their places by supplementing grants to various libraries in the states through Raja Ram Mohan Roy | 3128.72
Library Foundation | 3136.24
in line with the investment made by the states. | 3143.839
Appropriate provisions were made to increase the reading material and | 3146.559
along with this, by setting up the National Virtual Library, | 3151.52
we made lakhs of books | 3153.96
available in the virtual library so that | 3158.0
maximum number of people can take advantage of it in today's era of technology.  I | 3160.88
would like to request all the honorable members | 3163.359
present here that the | 3165.76
way the | 3167.319
state has stifled the libraries and district libraries in their areas, with the | 3169.88
efforts of the Government of India, we have | 3172.24
also stifled the rural libraries at some places, we have also stifled the | 3174.44
state level libraries.  If you | 3179.68
cooperate in increasing maximum awareness about it in your area, | 3182.079
then surely through it we will be | 3186.28
able to achieve more success in making the library reach people. |

Library provides funds to | 3286.799
one library and one district library in each state | 3289.44
for making model libraries. | 3292.04
