Honorable Member, you are requested to take your | 40.079
seats.  Biraj, when the Zero Hour starts, I | 50.719
will try to allow your question after seeing the arrangement. Now the Question Hour is going on. | 54.239
I have given an arrangement in the Question Hour that | 56.12
during the Question Hour, anyone can raise the | 61.0
statement laid on the table of the | 63.439
House.  Honorable Member Thank you Honorable Speaker, | 69.04
I | 73.2
would like to know from the Honorable Minister through you that all the medicines and | 80.159
equipment used for the treatment and prevention of diseases | 84.32
come under the Essential Commodities Act 1955 | 87.479
and medicines and equipment are included in the definition of essential commodities. | 91.04
Also come, but | 94.079
despite this, ceiling prices of all medicines and equipment are | 98.759
not fixed, due to which drug | 102.92
and equipment manufacturers | 105.759
mark 10 times the fixed MRP on them, due to | 110.24
which the patients and their family members are | 113.88
exploited. I, through you, appeal to the Honorable | 117.039
Minister.  I would like to ask, what | 120.2
action has the government taken for this? | 
###
126.399
Honorable Speaker, the member has | 136.16
asked an important question related to many health sector people. | 139.239
I am giving them the details of the way we | 143.64
work in our department. | 145.72
I would like to tell you about what it does, as far as drugs | 148.56
are concerned, first of all, the | 150.56
Health | 151.959
Department publishes the National List of Essential Medicines | 156.2
through which the medicines used for the treatment of very essential and | 160.879
life-threatening diseases are included | 165.76
in the Essential Medicines.  And about | 169.64
388 medicines 388 medicines have been added to it | 174.56
and after this | 179.28
we have divided our total drugs into two categories, | 181.92
schedule drugs and non-schedule | 185.28
drugs, which are schedule drugs, | 188.84
which are total drugs, a mixture of both, | 193.879
schedule drugs and non-scheduled drugs.  Scheduled drugs are | 197.519
around | 199.959
4000 348 plus | 205.12
i.e. | 206.64
4348 and almost a little more than that and | 210.12
out of which | 211.439
388 are included in schedule drugs and in that the | 240.439
drugs of medical devices and formulations are also sealed, | 243.439
their prices are also sealed | 245.76
and approximately 926 of these are  There | 250.239
are formulations which have been added in this and | 253.2
along with this, | 260.72
under the control order in Para 19 which is in our DPCO to control our prices, | 264.44
we also cap its margin, so in this | 268.12
manner, in every way  An | 271.84
effort has been made to control the medicines. In the trade margin | 274.24
rationalization approach, we see | 278.759
that the margin percentage in anti-cancer drugs should | 282.8
not be more than 30. | 285.199
We also keep this in mind and about 42 | 288.919
anti-cancer drugs have also been included in it.  If the | 294.6
honorable member asked what arrangements have been made to | 298.08
save the common man from this problem, | 300.44
then we do pricing on those drugs | 303.639
which are essential drugs | 307.12
and | 309.639
We also control their trade margins, | 312.24
but two programs | 315.44
which were newly launched under the leadership of respected Prime Minister Modi ji | 318.16
are the Jan Aushadhi program and | 322.4
in the Jan Aushadhi program, we sell a large quantity of | 325.919
drugs as generic drugs. | 330.0
And in it | 332.319
I am happy to tell | 344.4
that in large numbers we have | 350.12
1965 drugs and 293 surgical items in it and | 360.52
we can buy medicines and surgical items at about Rs 50 to 80 less than the market price | 363.44
and in this  Till now, | 369.16
patients have benefited to the tune of Rs 28000 crores, | 372.84
patients have | 374.68
benefited to the tune of Rs 28000 crores and these are 12600 Jan Aushadhi Centers and | 380.599
under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi ji, it has been | 382.599
decided that by 2027, 25000 Jan Aushadhi Centers will be | 387.199
opened and 55000 will be opened. | 391.599
So that any poor person and in this I am | 394.319
happy to tell you that there is a | 396.56
reduction in cancer drugs at Rs. 80, there is a reduction in drugs at Rs. 80. In the | 402.08
same way, | 405.8
a scheme is being run by the health department whose name | 408.28
is Amrit Affordable Medicine and Reliable. | 413.24
Under this implant treatment, till now almost 5 crore | 417.919
14 lakh patients have been given this service | 421.479
and drugs worth about Rs 10 crore 673 crore have been | 426.28
dispensed. | 428.84
Honorable Mann Kam Tagore ji, | 432.599
do not stand with your back turned and | 435.639
in this he  I will also give | 440.68
you the training and that too, the total saving that the patient is getting, | 445.56
this is about Rs | 448.199
24273 crores, | 450.039
due to the ceiling price, this is Rs | 454.0
7273 crores, due to the control on its price, the budget is being saved for the | 458.4
common man. | 
###
460.56
Supplementary | 463.84
Thanks, Honorable Chairman. | 466.28
While prescribing medicines, it is | 470.8
mandatory for the doctors to prescribe the medicines for the | 475.08
patients by generic name i.e. salt name only, | 479.68
but Honorable Speaker, it is seen | 481.36
that when the patients go to see the doctors, | 484.8
they should prescribe the same on their prescription. | 488.96
He writes the names of branded medicines due to | 492.879
which the | 494.08
patients and their family members have to | 497.84
buy very expensive medicines. | 501.479
Honorable Speaker, this is a requirement | 504.68
given for the doctors | 510.0
in the Regulation No. 1.5 and 6.3 of 2002 of the Indian Medical Council.  I | 515.44
would like to request the Honorable Minister through you | 517.24
that | 520.839
doctors should | 523.32
not force people to take branded medicines, what is the government's | 525.24
proposed scheme for this, please mention about it, that is | 528.48
my one. | 531.16
I conclude by saying with a request that | 533.48
SN Medical College in Agra is made up of 184 | 537.88
but till now it has not got the status of AIIMS. Sir, it | 543.12
is the third oldest medical college of India. Please give the status of AIIMS to S | 546.16
Medical College of Agra. | 
###
551.8
There are constant talks with the Indian Medical Association and they always try to | 555.16
prescribe generic medicines, but | 558.279
arrangements for generic medicines have been made under Jan Aushadhi. | 
###
560.72
Kirti Azad | 565.0
ji, Chairman, just told about the benefits, which is a | 569.36
matter of great pleasure, Health | 570.6
Minister.  I | 572.76
also want to know about some of the losses that have been incurred from them. | 574.76
Through the Drug Price Control Order, the Minister will be | 576.88
pleased to tell that there are many such | 579.519
medicines which are being sold above the MRP, | 582.279
which has also been banned by the National Pharmaceutical | 585.04
Pricing Authority.  I have seen and there are | 587.519
about 384 such companies out of which there is only one | 591.279
which has embezzled Rs. 1500 crores and | 595.399
in the last figures which I collected from Rajya Sabha | 597.6
in your reply that only Rs. | 600.04
72 or 73 crores, | 
###
631.6
Honorable Minister, if anyone is specific in that?  If | 635.839
you give this to us in writing, then definitely | 638.48
action will be taken against it |

Sir, this scheme is well made, but | 710.2
I am | 713.88
getting complaints in my Parliament House about Ayushman Bharat. | 716.6
So, it has become very difficult to make its card. | 720.36
First of all, I | 723.079
would like to ask the Minister whether you have imposed any limit | 726.04
on it. | 729.079
Secondly, there are many Ayushman cards. There is | 733.72
no question of Ayushman card, so | 736.199
Sir, it is Ayushman's, it | 739.56
is his only.  Yes Sir, | 743.279
let's go, it belongs to him Sir Sir, the other Papen | 748.199
hospitals | 749.839
which provide free treatment, they | 752.68
refuse many poor people, Honorable Minister, please | 756.079

768.48
thanks to you, Speaker of the House, Sir, first of all, | 773.16
through you, | 775.92
I want to present a figure before the honorable member of his | 778.519
Lok Sabha constituency, since he has | 782.399
raised the issue of the number of cards of Ayushman Bharat, till now Fatehgarh Sahib, in the context of yours, | 787.44
we are | 790.76
27000 555 cards have been made. | 797.639
If I talk about your state, | 801.639
in Punjab we have | 808.12
made 84.999535 cards so far. | 812.16
I want to tell the honorable member of Ayushman | 816.72
that when the Honorable Prime Minister | 820.839
launched this scheme in 2018, Jharkhand  The | 824.0
beneficiary base we had at that time was | 827.76
10 crore 74 lakhs, which subsequently | 830.56
increased to 12 crore 34 lakhs and | 834.6
we are continuously trying to | 837.68
speed up the creation of Ayushman cards. The | 843.56
performance of some states in this is very good.  It is good in which my | 845.399
home state Uttar Pradesh is also there, Bihar is | 848.16
also there, Andhra Pradesh is also there, there are many such | 850.48
states, Maharashtra is also there, sir, Ayushman | 853.56
card and for this we have launched a | 856.8
special initiative to make it faster, Ayushman at | 859.24
your doorstep, Ayushman at your doorstep, one  There is such an | 863.079
initiative through which we are sending our | 865.44
frontline health workers like Asha Hai | 868.0
NM for door to door | 871.68
campaign and making the | 874.639
beneficiaries | 876.36
aware that they should come and get their | 879.36
cards made.  And for this, we have | 882.48
simplified the process of making Ayushman card and | 885.079
also sir, we have also nominated six agencies | 888.519
so that Ayushman card can be | 891.48
made very fast and our | 894.68
beneficiaries can get its benefits. Mr. Second | 898.6
Sir, you have the second | 900.48
question.  How can you, Honorable Minister, | 904.44
ask the member to ask a second question? | 910.839
Sir, no, there are no two parts. His question | 915.079
number one is of Arun Bharti and let me | 919.639
explain the arrangement for a minute. Arun Bharti and Dr. | 922.36
Amar Singh, there is a supplementary question to Arun Bharti | 926.72
but the second one.  There is only one question to the number, | 930.8
Sir Sir, thank you Speaker Sir Sir, this | 
###
935.519
Ayushman | 936.639
Pradhan Mantri Jan Aayog Yojana, this health | 940.92
insurance scheme, it was lunch in | 943.959
2018 to provide health coverage to 50 50 people, | 947.72
sir, it is late, there has been an instance reported | 951.24
where hospital has experience.  Delay in the | 954.68
Reimbursement of Cm This is in Tam Late the | 958.399
Hospital Refusing to Accept the | 960.279
Patient Has The Government Noticed the Issue for | 963.6
Delay and If So What Steps Have the | 965.839
Government Taken to Avoid the Delay for the Present | 
###
968.92
Honorable Minister | 972.24
Sir Ayushman | 974.839
Bharat Yeh Duniya Ka  This is the largest publicly | 979.44
funded health assurance program which was | 982.399
launched by Modi ji's government. We have a | 985.279
very large beneficiary base in which | 988.92
we are providing tertiary and secondary care facilities to the people in the bottom 40. In the | 991.88
question | 995.36
asked by the honorable member, I can clearly explain in this.  I | 998.759
would like to tell you that we have | 1010.36
also converted the beneficiary base identification as per the SEC data as per the | 1019.04
sharing of 6040 and | 1022.199
when it comes to claim settlement in any state, | 1024.88
whatever funds are transferred from our side to the | 1028.039
states.  There is never | 1030.199
any delay in the releases, but sometimes there are problems regarding the additional | 1033.0
beneficiaries added by the states | 1035.799
whose expenses have to be borne by the states, | 1038.919
but | 1041.64
whenever such a situation develops, we always | 1044.24
talk to  The states communicate with | 1046.36
them and these problems have been resolved. | 1048.96
Apart from this we have also started an initiative of green channel | 1051.559
payment. Sir, this | 1054.72
initiative is intended to expedite the | 1058.039
claim settlement so that we see more and more | 1060.6
participation of the empaneled hospitals | 1063.96
hospitals which have  A clean record we | 1066.32
give them % of upfront payment so that is how we | 1069.32
try to expedite this whole process | 
###
1071.28
Mr. Arvind Sawant ji Honorable | 1074.919
President, thank you very much this scheme is | 1077.72
very good but I have a very pointed | 1080.559
question which is the private hospital which is the | 1083.32
trustee.  They have | 1085.08
accepted the scheme of Ayushman Bharat in this but there are | 1088.0
some private hospitals which do | 1090.0
not accept it. Sir, there is a hospital in Parel, after | 1092.88
wearing them, asked why they do | 1095.12
not do Ayushman Bharat within India, then they said that the | 1097.0
insurance money does not come on time.  So, | 1099.799
what can you do for such hospitals | 1102.08
because it is | 1105.0
very important to empanel them, now if you | 1107.24
look at the population of Maharashtra, there are 1000 24 hospitals, which is | 1110.0
very less. If you compare with Karnataka or anyone else, | 1112.24
then what will the government do for that? | 1115.039
Steps will be taken that those who do | 1117.76
not want to come in the private hospital panel, the trustees | 1120.2
come deliberately, the private ones are not coming, | 1122.12
I have taken the name deliberately so that you can be | 1125.12
differentiated | 1126.84
and to pay the insurance money on time. | 1129.76
Thank you,  | 
###
1133.36
Chairman Sir, this is the second part of your question.  Regarding claim | 1136.44
settlement, I mentioned it in my earlier answer. | 1138.36
As far as empanelment is concerned, it is | 1141.4
our constant endeavor to keep | 1148.36
expanding the network of empaneled hospitals. For this, Sir, the National | 1152.28
Health Authority is in charge of our | 1154.559
state government.  We keep talking to the health authorities | 1156.76
continuously and we regularly touch them with all our | 1160.72
private hospital associations | 1163.12
etc. | 1166.76
If they are not aware about this scheme, | 1169.08
then we also make them aware through workshops if | 1171.52
they have any apprehensions | 1174.12
or clarifications.  We also | 1177.28
remove the packages etc. that we have created, the | 1180.2
health benefit packages, we have also | 1182.84
revised them from time to time, now we have | 1185.559
brought it up to 1949 procedures and | 1188.28
we have given the flexibility to the states that if you | 1190.88
want, you can add it as per your convenience.  Customization | 1194.039
can also be done, so we try our best and | 1199.28
we explain all our procedures regarding claim settlement in detail to all the | 1201.72
hospitals, that is, we | 1204.559
hold their hands, train them, make them | 1207.28
aware and as much as possible. | 1210.64
We also add and sir, there has been a huge | 1212.799
progress in this because when we | 1215.96
launched this program in 2018, the | 1218.48
number of M panel hospitals was | 1220.96
around 8000 but today it has increased to | 1224.52
2921. Today there is a special focus on this department.  There is a long | 1229.48
discussion, I would request the Honorable Minister and the Honorable | 1232.72
Members to leave a | 1234.76
reservation when this topic is to be discussed. |

1466.399
Sir, I very clearly | 1470.08
want to tell the House through you that this | 1473.44
Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission of ours  It | 1479.84
uses a fully federated digital architecture and it is fully compliant with the | 1483.279
provision of the Digital Personal Data | 1485.799
Protection Act As my senior minister | 1489.44
explained there are four verticals and four | 1491.84
components one of the components of creation of | 1494.6
the Aabha ID  This is a unique identification | 1497.279
number given on a digital health ecosystem | 1501.6
to every patient. | 1510.799
No centralized repository of any kind is maintained for the personal health | 1514.32
records of the patient. The personal data of the patient's health records is stored only with his/her consent. | 1517.679
Can be shared and only those | 1520.88
records which are maintained by us with respect to Aaba | 1523.679
ID Registry or which are our Health | 1526.679
Practitioners Registry or | 1528.44
Facility Registry that are stored | 1530.6
centrally for the ease of interoperability so there is | 1534.08
no threat as such in so far as the | 1537.36
Safety of the personal health record of the | 1540.559
patient is a concern |

Reddy Ji Had Failed | 1566.52
To Pay The Private | 1570.12
Hospital Because Of The Duty Is Outstanding | 1572.919
Now Even Ayushman Bharat Is Being Affected | 1575.159
Because Arogya Shree Program Run By The | 1578.0
State Government I Today Clubbed With | 1580.159
Ayushman Bharat But Having Said The Sir My | 1583.24
Supplementary Would Be To Question 163 | 1586.12
Section  Where the question arises is | 1589.88
about the assessment of the Ayushman Bharat | 1592.72
scheme as per the scheme a norms every | 1597.159
patient who is availing the benefit of | 1599.52
Ayushman Bharat is expected to | 1601.919
produce his Aadhaar identity and then | 1604.279
avail the scheme but many a times the Aadhaar.  The | 1607.039
card is not presented and then the patient | 1610.919
is required to give a written as signed | 1614.399
declaration that he will produce it when he | 1616.84
goes to avail Ayushman Bharat for the second | 1619.84
time but | 1627.88
unfortunately | 1633.6
phrases that have been happening in the system | 1636.48
and if so what are  The Measures That Have Been | 1638.48
Taken To Control This Kind Of Pilferage | 1640.88
Thank You | 1642.799
Sir | 
###
1645.96
Sir I Would Like To Online The Nare Bal Member | 1650.559
That The Question Does Not Relate To Ayushman | 1653.2
Bharat The Question Relates To The Abha | 1657.679
Card The Health Accounts So And Aa We  The | 1662.159
minister has explained and I have also explained how | 1663.919
this Aabha card is helpful | 1666.36
for the patient and the confidentiality is | 1668.48
maintained as the Ayushman Bharat is concerned The | 1671.08
question is not related to the | 1674.159
question asked is not related to this | 1676.64
question but yes  Therefore, the Ayushman Bharat | 1681.559
PM Jai Program is concerned that it is being | 1684.96
run by the National Health Authority and in the | 1688.12
National Health Authority there is a constant | 1691.0
mechanism of supervision and we also have | 1695.919
direct connect with the State Health | 1698.48
Authorities and we always follow it. | 1701.519
Quality of Service Being Given The Payments | 1705.36
Being Done And The Patient Satisfaction These | 1709.799
Three Factors Are Taken To Consideration And | 1711.88
It Is A Continuous Process It Is A | 1713.6
Regular Process While Being Done One Of The | 1717.559
Questions Being Raised By The Members That The | 1720.6
Claim Are Not  Settle it is some times it | 1723.48
happens because the state government does not give it | 1726.96
share then it happens and there was previous question also | 1730.84
and I would like | 1732.559
to share with you in that previous question it was | 1736.039
stated | 1738.279
Amar Singh ji was asking about that | 1739.96
question I  Would like to share with it that | 1742.36
in State of Punjab the Central Government has | 1745.24
given it Share | 1747.279
59.96 crore has been released by Central | 1750.44
Share State has to actually send the demand | 1753.919
in an audited statement because the State | 1757.399
Government is not sending the audited | 1759.159
statement we  Are not able to release the fund | 1761.32
for 2024 25 So because of that there is some | 1765.32
problem or in such states I | 1767.679
would request the rebel member to see that | 1770.08
the State Health Authority of | 1772.159
Ayushman Bharat should ensure that they  Put their | 1775.88
shares in time so that the patients are in the | 1779.72
hospital and the institution get the | 1783.08
payments in | 1784.64
time  |

Shinde Hari Bhai | 1795.36
Patel | 1802.48
Vasque Ok, this is a good idea of ​​yours, at | 1807.399
least no member has come.  The | 1809.559
reason for not coming in writing, Honorable Speaker | 1811.6
Sir, Question No. | 1818.48
164 Sir Question Number | 1821.44
164, | 1825.799
Honorable Speaker Sir, thank you for | 1829.559
giving me the opportunity to ask a question, | 1832.519
Honorable Speaker Sir, through you, | 1835.36
I want to ask about | 1838.6
AIIMS Rajkot in our Gujarat state.  The government is providing | 1842.039
every possible help here, for this we are | 1847.24
expressing our gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Health Minister. I | 1850.08
also want to ask through you, Speaker Sir, | 1853.76
that the government is thinking of giving a second S in the state of Gujarat. | 1856.2
What and also | 1858.96
Maisana North is a big city of Gujarat. | 1861.84
I request the Honorable Minister | 1864.24
that a CGHS center will be opened here. | 
###
1870.6
This question is related to All India Medical | 1873.2
Sciences and | 1875.84
All India Medical Sciences will be opened in Rajkot in the state of Gujarat.  It is | 1878.32
very good that it is moving forward | 1882.36
and it can be corrected by consolidating it | 1885.919
so that the regional imbalance can be stopped | 1888.519
and the people of Gujarat can avail its services. | 1890.6
As far as CGHS is concerned, | 1893.039
they have said that this is also a continuous | 1894.84
process, they will apply for it.  We | 1897.919
can consider it by taking its own view. | 
###
1900.84
Mr. A. | 1907.12
Raja, Respected Minister Government, I am | 1911.0
highly disappointed to see the answer given by | 1914.48
Minister Sir AIIMS for Madras in Tamil Nadu | 1918.399
was announced that he is back for four years with the | 1921.84
assistance of the external fund.  From the Japan | 1924.88
Government in spite of announcement no | 1928.159
allocation has been made no preliminary | 1930.32
construction has been started this issue was | 1933.24
debated during the two elections in Tamil Nadu | 1936.039
Minister came to Tamil Nadu fearing the election | 1938.44
campaign and said the Tamilnad people are not | 1941.48
feeling the real national  Integration Sir With | 1945.88
Due Respect I Want To House We The | 1949.2
People Of Tamil Nadu Are Second To None To | 1953.08
Say That We Are Having Full National Consent To | 1955.96
Maintain The Integration You Question Sir | 1958.519
Sir Aam Coming Sir Moran Four Years In The Same | 1963.039
House  Carol Arens was given after the French | 1966.559
Minister funds will be allocated till no | 1970.2
brick a single brick was not laid down in the | 1973.12

the list I am not there it is the correct | 1979.519
attitude towards Tamil  And Tamil Nadu sir | 1981.519
please clarify we are highly | 1984.08
disappointed | 
###
1987.36
please sir I respect the sentiments of the | 1991.519
rebel member Madhurai has been All India of | 1996.679
Medical Sciences we have been suctioned and | 1998.679
cleared by the cabinet we are very much concerned because | 2001.32
of some technical reason it has | 2004.639
Been delayed and we accept the delay but the | 2008.159
government is committed and the work has | 2010.76
started and very soon you will see the | 2013.519
construction and will take | 2017.559
place  | 
###
2022.2
Nishikant Dubey ji Speaker | 2024.679
Sir Honorable Prime Minister did a great | 2027.679
job a doctor from our area | 2029.679
Had given AIIMS there Sir, my | 2036.72
Deoghar minister has replied sir | 2040.12
that if OPD patients are seen least anywhere in AIIMS, | 2043.84
then they were seen in AIIMS Deoghar, the | 2046.559
reason for that is that the emergency | 2049.72
facility is there despite wanting it.  Meaning, | 2054.04
even after repeated orders from the Minister, | 2056.2
it is not able to be started. Through you, I | 2058.679
request the Minister to know when the | 2061.0
OPD facility will be started in our place | 2063.8
along with the emergency. It would be nice to know the | 2067.44
importance of it. | 
###
2072.599
I take into account the concerns of the honorable members and their | 2078.28
concerns | 2081.32
but I | 2083.32
want to tell one thing to everyone through this question and that is, | 2089.639
All India Int because this question is very | 2093.359
important.  What is our vision of All India Institute | 2096.0
of Medical Sciences? What is | 2098.24
our vision? | 2101.24
What | 2102.16
is our vision and it has been fulfilled to a great extent | 2106.52
that people from every corner of the country do | 2110.68
not come to Delhi for their treatment | 2113.88
and | 2115.8
their All India Institute of Medical Sciences  The | 2118.76
way the services are provided in Delhi, | 2120.88
All India of Medical Sciences with the same brand name | 2125.92
and that is why | 2133.48
during this period the Honorable Prime Minister made an effort to open 17 plus All India of Medical | 2137.76
Sciences in every region of the country, one | 2142.24
each.  One All India Medical | 2146.72
Sciences to be built at a cost of Rs 1200 crore to Rs 2000 | 2150.24
crore, All | 2152.839
India Medical Sciences with world best | 2157.079
tertiary health care system world best. Now the | 2162.44
third thing is that they are building the world best structure. | 2165.72
I tell everyone and I | 2168.2
For your better understanding, L' | 2171.2
India Medical Sciences had come to Delhi in 50's | 2173.599
but the recognition of All India Institute of Medical | 2176.64
Sciences came in 70's and 80's.  If | 2192.92
you want then the standards of L India Medical Sciences are | 2194.76
very different, their | 2197.599
standards are not equal to those of any other district hospital, the | 2202.88
doctors of the district hospital also do private practice, | 2204.599
24 | 2208.119
7 365 hours are available in the campus serving the  The | 2214.359
amount of expenditure per patient is | 2217.8
very different and it does not match with any other | 2222.119
institution. Now what happens in this? I, the | 2224.839
Health Minister, would say that when we look at the categories, | 2227.52
suppose | 2234.2
we have 10 posts for appointing a faculty.  Did an interview for AIIMS | 2237.28
50 people came in the interview 60 people came | 2240.88
How do the results of the interview come Not | 2243.68
found fit Not found fit We review again | 2247.88
but we do not dilute the standards of AIIMS | 2252.72
because we have to | 2255.8
keep it on the same so see Nishikant ji | 2258.56
that  The days were very happy when Deoghar | 2260.28
got All India Medical Sciences. I | 2262.88
express their concern and to all of you, | 2264.64
someone will ask about Bathinda, | 2266.72
someone will ask about Bilaspur, | 2268.96
this is the problem everywhere, we have fixed the faculty. | 2272.76
Will grow it will take 10 to 15 years to | 2275.4
become an International Faculty of Every All | 2278.72
India Institute of Medical Sciences and we are striving for that, | 2280.839
hence from today in the 60s of the country, | 2284.319
President, I want to take your time and | 2286.119
lighten everyone 60 more  In 70, | 2288.88
our best doctor used to say that we do not have | 2290.56
the facility in the country and that is why we are | 2292.48
going outside and today Prime | 2295.28
Minister Modi has | 2297.68
created | 2300.04
class and hence now to fill it, hardware is | 2304.079
there, we are trying to put software into | 2308.079
the best possible.  Efforts are being made to install the most modern | 2310.64
software |

Hanal Speaker Sir, I | 2337.48
would like to thank you for the first time through Star Question that | 2340.52
I got the opportunity to ask a question in the Lok Sabha. | 2343.4
My question was to which the | 2347.44
Honorable Minister replied. | 2350.16
I have come to tell Rebel Minister | 2353.8
ji that there was a time when | 2359.0
we considered Dhanvantari ji as God and | 2364.359
we know him by the name of the world's greatest doctor and | 2366.64
Ayurvedic, which was an ancient medical system. | 2370.0
Gandhamardan, the area from where I have come, | 2372.76
we all know the meaning of Gandhamardan. | 2375.88
In the era of Ramayana, Hanuman had lifted the entire Gandhamardan with the help of Vishal Karni. There | 2382.839
is an Ayurvedic college under the same Gandhamardan mountain and in the same Ayurvedic | 2385.359
college, Gandhamardan, you can  Listen to Mahabharata, you | 2388.44
ask questions. Yes, yes, this | 2392.24
report came in the story of narrating Mahabharata. It | 2397.68
was the report of Bonica Survey of India. Sir, more than 2000 | 2400.56
botanical plants are present in that Gandhamadan, out of which | 2405.2
222 are in the name of rare herbal medicine.  It is known that | 2408.2
its survey was not done properly, | 2410.72
a survey should be conducted on it and if that medical college will be | 2413.16
taken under the control of the Central Government, this is | 2416.079
my proposal and the members of that committee have | 2417.96
also given their opinion in writing. I | 2419.92
want to know that a  One survey is about | 2422.4
how many herbs are there on the Gandhamadan hills and the second | 2424.8
time is for the same college. If the Central Government | 2427.319
wants to take any proposal, it is up to them. | 2432.079
Speaker | 
###
2434.56
Sir, the honorable member who | 2437.8
raised the question here | 2439.839
on Gandhmardan hills | 2443.76
told that 2200 are | 2446.16
some forest medicines.  Plants or shrubs are there | 2451.44
but according to the information received from Botanical Survey of India (BSI), | 2457.4
during 2009, a | 2460.96
total of 912 plant species were found in the Dim Garh hills of Bargarh, Orissa, out of which | 2468.68
345 species were classified as medicinal plants | 2472.68
and received from the state government. | 2475.96
According to the information, there are | 2478.76
only 220 medicinal plants in the Gandhamardan hills. | 2482.88
I am not reading that, I am reading others. So, | 2485.4
Mr. Speaker, the | 2489.0
question that was raised here has been conserved | 2492.119
and the vegetation found there has | 2495.4
also been taken up with the Ministry of Life for its conservation.  The | 2497.92
fund is allocated  | 
###
2506.64
in the report that came to you about the herbal medicine from the Orissa government, | 2508.599
there was Viju Janata Dal government, there was a | 2510.88
mining company run by those people against whom a | 2513.119
huge movement was started, the | 2514.68
same movement for the safety of Gandhamardan.  Since we have | 2516.119
come into politics, their report which is | 2518.04
not correct, I want to request you | 2520.04
that the whistling smell that has come out of the speech, | 2522.92
then conduct a survey on it once from your department. | 2525.92
I want one, can you get a survey done? | 2528.0
Secondly, the one which  There is an Ayurvedic | 2529.88
College, after the arrival of Modi ji, the | 2532.16
ancient medical system has got a boost. | 2534.119
Earlier it was suppressed, then the same | 2536.64
Ayurveda is there where there are more than 2000 | 2539.0
Botanical Medicinal Parts nurses. If | 2541.28
we can use it, then the Central | 2542.76
Government is a big help.  A big | 2544.8
ritual can be made on this scale. Will the Central | 2546.76
Government take any proposal regarding this? Will the Central Government take any proposal regarding this? | 
###
2549.28
Sir, the work of the Ministry of AYUSH is to | 2553.76
promote Ayurveda and | 2556.2
propagate Ayurveda. The honorable | 2559.44
member who has asked the question here has said that there is a | 2562.04
lot of construction on Gandhamardan mountain.  There are all such | 2564.48
plants which can be used to make medicines in Ayurveda, the | 2570.24
earlier survey was done, they say that the | 2573.119
survey was not correct, if the | 2576.4
survey is done again, then definitely we will | 2579.72
also do the survey again.  We will | 2582.96
give instructions to the PSI there and | 2592.64
we will certainly try to conserve whatever forest medicinal plants are found there. He | 2596.0
said about the SSN Vidyalaya that it is | 2599.4
proposed to be authorized by the government.  It is clear | 2602.72
that no such proposal has | 2605.2
come to our ministry | 2609.28
and what he said about the Biological Diversity Board will | 2612.04
definitely be surveyed through it too. | 
###
2614.8
Shri Saptagiri | 2621.72
Ulka Speaker Sir I agree with the | 2624.559
sentiments of my noble colleague the | 2627.2
previous BJD Government.  In Orissa they have | 2629.96
slipped into mining and they destroyed most | 2632.64
of the tribal areas. Sir, this is Ayurvedic | 2635.68
medicine. We | 2639.96
use this forest medicine in many tribal dominated areas in the Niyamgiri hills and in the Eastern Ghats. Is the | 2643.119
government taking any such steps?  Which is | 2646.359
that these plant spaces are having | 2648.92
traditional medicinal uses. Can you | 2652.359
conduct a survey on this? Sir, the second thing is that you | 2654.88
told that out of the six Ayurvedic colleges | 2657.04
in Orissa, five are defunct, so | 2660.44
what steps is the government taking to improve these Ayurvedic colleges? | 2662.64
Start it again and in research, you | 2665.28
say that not even a single college is making any contribution, | 2667.839
then what is your step from the government side | 2670.839
so that you will be able to do this research, tell me | 2673.24
what steps are you taking for this. | 2675.28
Thank you. | 
###
2677.44
Sir, what the member asked was that | 2681.559
regarding the six colleges of Orissa, | 2684.48
our council definitely | 2687.76
looks after them. According to the standards, | 2690.28
whatever are the rules of the council, the | 2693.04
colleges are recognized only through that and | 2695.559
he said.  When asked about the help given to these colleges, then | 2698.2
SNN | 2701.2
Ayurvedic College in Paikmal Bargarh, Odisha has been | 2710.599
given Rs. 12 lakhs for setting up a herbal garden in an area of ​​two hectares and another for a | 2714.559
herbal nursery.  An amount | 2718.88
of Rs 19.2 lakh has also been approved for the establishment of AYUSH and | 2721.96
if the colleges also promote herbal gardens or | 2724.88
herbal nurseries, then | 2728.04
they are definitely given help from the Ministry of AYUSH. |

hills.  It is very | 2743.599
rich botanically. Through you, I | 2747.24
would like to know from the Honorable Minister that the | 2749.119
Botanical Survey of India has done | 2751.559
any detailed study of the medicinal plants in the Aravalli hills | 2753.72
and secondly, what | 2755.88
is the quality of the society?  They come from India and they | 2758.4
treat them traditionally, so is there | 2761.28
any proposal to inform them somewhere? What is your | 2762.88
idea? | 2765.599
Thank you,  |

Chairman, I have already told you that the work of the Ministry of AYUSH is to | 2771.599
promote Ayurveda, to propagate Ayurveda | 2774.24
and which  He told that whatever | 2780.16
treatment people provide in villages or in remote departments in rural areas, an | 2782.24
effort is definitely made to connect the same through Ayurvedic medium | 2785.04
through our ministry. | 2796.839
Questions asked regarding medicinal plants here and abroad, if | 2799.0
asked in writing, will be answered in writing. |

Sir and Minister Reply Very carefully There is no doubt that | 2823.52
Cowan is a good vaccine for Covid | 2828.16
and internationally accepted as true but it is a | 2832.359
strange | 2833.48
case The Cowan was developed and discovered by the | 2839.52
Indian Council of Medical Research at | 2843.119
National Institute of | 2845.839
Virology Too much of Virology spent 35 crores | 2850.92
on  Developing the | 2853.96
vaccine the minister gave the breakdown of how much Rs | 2857.76
35 crore was spent | 2862.599
including Rs 20 crore for phase 1 clinical | 2866.599
trial but the strange thing is that the patent for the vaccine was initially | 2872.76
given alone by the company Bharat | 2878.0

The Question is very Relevent First Of All Id Like To | 2928.52
Explain | 2930.4
How | 2932.68
Combustion A How Go F | 2936.92
See | 2937.64
The Indian Council of Medical | 2940.72
Research and An | 2945.079
IV National Institute of | 2947.96
Virology There is a Joint MoU with the | 2952.88
BBL The Bharat Biotech International Limited | 2959.28
and We Together | 2963.48
and the Program of Developing the Vaccine | 2969.76
Undertaken | 2971.52
Sorry | 2975.48
Sir Honorable Minister | 2979.28
I  I am explaining the complete procedure, | 2985.72
as I said that an | 2989.44
MOU was signed | 2997.52
between ICMR National Institute of Virology which is a part of it and BB Oil Bharat Biotech International Limited | 3000.04
and under that the | 3003.839
process of developing the vaccine started.  There | 3006.799
were two parts. The first part was to | 3011.079
isolate the virus and to isolate the virus | 3015.16
and study its challenge and | 3018.28
testing the vaccine neutralization | 3021.119
against the variant strain of SARS CoV | 3025.119
2 and the operational and miscellaneous tasks in BSL Fo. | 3029.0
That was to be done and | 3032.72
almost the entire work of this work was done by ICMR, | 3037.24
Indian Council for Medical Research did it | 3039.599
and it was done in the National Institute of | 3041.72
Virology and we | 3044.04
spent Rs. 1.5 crores in the same way for | 3047.16
laboratory testing and samples.  For this, | 3049.359
we spent six plus crores of rupees and the | 3053.0
subsequent development work of phase three was | 3055.72
done by BB IL and in this | 3060.76
I want to tell that we | 3063.52
spent Rs 35 crores, 35 35 crores rupees were spent. | 3066.72
BB IL spent Rs 60 plus crores to | 3070.599
develop the vaccine, hence it | 3073.319
was a joint venture and this | 3077.559
vaccine came in the market under joint venture. | 3081.92
BB | 3084.68
IL also gave Rs 170 crores to ICMR as royalty on this vaccine, hence it was a joint venture. | 3089.72
This program was run as a venture and | 3093.319
one thing definitely happened was that BB IL | 3096.96
wrote to our IPT and for the patent | 3100.72
they indicated their name in it that it should be done by | 3104.64
BB IL. | 3106.52
When the | 3109.559
Government of India and ICMR | 3112.359
got information about it on the same day.  We raised this question | 3116.68
that this is an MOU in which we have given you Rs. | 3123.68
3 crores for clinical trials and for clinical trials we have spent not Rs. 20 crores but Rs. 20 | 3127.68
crores. For the third trial it was very | 3129.559
costly and it was very | 3131.68
important.  For the vaccine to come in to the | 3134.4
market, this joint contribution | 3137.44
was ours but in that they | 3141.559
kept their own name in the co-ownership and co-ventor and not anyone else's. | 3144.359
The moment we came to know about it | 3148.92
we filed the objection and I would like  To | 3152.599
inform this house that it has been corrected now | 3156.28
ICMR Virology plus our three | 3159.119
scientists are the co-inventors and co-owners and | 3163.44
they have got the ownership and we the members and | 3167.4
BB IL have also acknowledged that in this advertisement | 3172.04
we have given the co-inventor and co- | 3174.88
ownership to them.   | 
###
3177.799
Sir, if it had been anordinary people then it would have been missed in this | 3182.359
advertisement. What was missed was to mention the name of ICMR, he would have been | 3186.28
punished for that | 3189.92
because these people are illiterate people, hence | 3193.68
no action was taken against them. I am just trying to | 3196.76
point out, Sir, my question is this.  I | 3201.799
want to know whether the ICO | 3203.2
vaccine is very effective during | 3206.2
the | 3207.44
Corona epidemic and it is exported | 3211.68
abroad the Prime Minister claims India | 3214.96
Vishva Guru in ICO vaccine cares to tell us how many | 3220.0
shots of Covid manufactured in India | 3226.319
and how many shots are exported  Abroad | 3229.72
to how many countries, | 
###
3231.839
okay, it is not related to this question, | 3234.48
but let me tell you one thing that in | 3237.2
total, we delivered the vaccine to 100 countries under Vaccine | 3239.96
Maitri | 3245.64
and it is subject to correction because I do | 3249.2
not have its details, there is no data.  There is no | 3252.559
question, there is no question, this is the same | 3257.28
Dada question, but | 3262.88
India has given free medicine to 48 countries in Vaccine Maitri, | 3266.48
this should also be kept in mind | 3268.96
and | 3271.079
220 220 crore 220 crore double dose, this is the | 3277.839
world's largest and world's | 3281.2
fastest in India.  Vaccination program has | 3283.88
also taken place | 3285.67
[praise] | 3289.839
We stand for a minute Corrected Seven | 3293.72
countries have been vaccinated | 3300.599
Tell me one thing Is there any objection in this I have also | 3303.839
been to many countries of the world and everyone told me that | 3306.599
India's vaccine is the best. |

question number 167 Shri Rajesh | 3316.28
Ranjan | 3317.799
67 Honorable Minister | 3320.319
's description placed on the table of the House | 3323.76
Honorable Minister Sir, | 3332.599
in your own economic survey, the economic survey has just come, | 3338.319
Pappu ji, there is only so much time in that, look at the watch, social | 3341.72
media, social media, | 3345.559
drugs, | 3347.52
ingram.  And 70 percent of the youth are | 3351.839
on social media in their daily life, | 3353.76
continuously consume bad drugs, | 3357.68
continuously consume water like arsenic iron | 3363.96
and physically only 54 percent of the youth of this country | 3374.76
use it in their life | 3377.359
after that. | 3378.92
Lack of constant mental stress is | 3382.839
your problem in many economic surveys, so what is the reason for | 3386.28
this, due to which the youth of India are being | 3391.119
affected the most, in such states as Mizoram, | 3393.359
Tamil Nadu, Telangana, | 3394.68
Kerala, Tripura, there are | 3398.799
continuously 70 60 cases of HIV/AIDS in such states. | 3404.359
This has been found among the youth now and this is | 3407.839
in the survey, so is the government taking any other initiative in this regard, there is | 3413.799
not just the report of WAO, there are many such reports, | 3417.28
Minister, in which it is very clear | 3420.48
that India is in comparison to other countries.  The | 3423.559
youth are more | 3425.72
depressed, tend to use the media | 3428.68
more, live amidst filth, is there | 3431.24
any initiative of the government on this? | 
###
3433.76
Honorable Speaker, the question that | 3437.88
he has asked is that the adult population of India is | 3440.68
physically unfit. Does this | 3443.599
indicate the report of WAO? | 3446.839
Now from the point of view of unfit, what he has | 3449.559
said about the question and he has said that the | 3452.0
people of India are unfit at 59.9, I | 3460.559
want to give a little answer to the people of the country through the honorable member and tell | 3463.48
that the WAO's  The report is not of fit and unfit. The | 3467.52
report of WAO is that | 3472.839
at 59.9 people do not | 3476.64
do enough physical activity. Sufficient | 3480.119
physical activity and infit physical | 3483.119
activity. After this there is a report in between, fit | 3486.119
and unfit. When we say it, we take it | 3490.119
very seriously.  Now, the | 3493.359
adequate physical activity | 3495.44
mentioned by them in fit is 75 minutes of Vigorous | 3499.559
Intensity Activity per week, running, | 3504.079
construction work, outdoor games, etc. Those who do this | 3506.92
come in the adequate category and in the same | 3510.359
manner as per the report of WAO, | 3514.72
this self  There is a reported scheme so there is | 3517.96
no question of fit or unfit, the question is whether doing sufficient physical | 3521.119
activity or doing insufficient physical | 3523.88
activity and I | 3526.799
think you and I too would | 3530.24
fall in this category of adequate physical activity and | 3532.4
many members in this, | 3537.44
you too  Question Hour will come only in these sufficient rooms [ | 3541.58
