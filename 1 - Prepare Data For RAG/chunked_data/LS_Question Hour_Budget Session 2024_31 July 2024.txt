In question number | 8.8
two, I did not ask you. I did | 17.119
not ask you in the direction. | 21.039
Question | 24.64
number: First of all, | 27.039
Modi ji has been | 35.399
placed on the table of Bhai Patel ji. Question one to one: Honorable member. Answer: | 37.96
First of all, I would like to thank Prime Minister | 41.52
Narendra Modi ji.  I want to convey my best wishes | 44.559
that Modi ji has become the second Prime Minister | 47.239
in the history of independence, who has | 49.52
formed the government with full majority for the third time. I | 52.8
want to ask the Railway Minister, | 55.239
what is the current status of the construction of Bullet Train and | 57.12
also what is the government's plan for Bullet Train in India.  How | 60.76
long do you plan to run the train and what is its coverage | 62.96
network? What is the | 67.68
number of Vande Bharat trains under construction and the route and state? | 71.0
Also, does the government plan to | 74.36
start Vande Bharat train from Valsad to Mumbai or Delhi? | 76.88
And if yes, then what is its bureau? | 80.4
If not, then what is the reason? | 84.0
Honorable Speaker, the | 
###
87.92
question asked by the Honorable MP is a very | 89.92
important question. Honorable Speaker, | 93.88
Bullet Train is a very | 96.479
complex project, which if we | 100.68
look at a normal  As long as the vehicle | 104.36
runs at a speed of 50, 60, 100 km, | 108.32
its vibrations and the kind of | 110.88
impact it has between the track and the rail are | 114.52
very less, but as soon as the | 117.2
vehicle travels at a speed of more than 250 km.  It | 120.92
seems that there are a lot of | 126.24
complexities in its design. The details have been designed very carefully with an in-depth study on the design | 129.92
and by discussing | 133.319
with the best experts of Japan, which are its | 139.84
foundation, which are the pillars and which are the ways.  The | 143.4
duct is there, Mr. Speaker, around that corner. | 148.519
Progress of 320 kilometers has been made in it. The total | 151.12
project is 508 kilometers, out of which | 154.239
320 kilometers of foundation pier and viaduct have already been built. There was a | 162.239
slight delay in the work in Maharashtra initially, but as soon as Mr. | 165.56
Shinde ji  And Shri Devendra Fadnavis ji's | 168.12
government came, immediately he gave all the permissions | 171.08
and now all the land acquisition work has been completed in Maharashtra too. The | 174.68
work of BKC station is going on very fast. | 177.159
Honorable Speaker, there is another very unique thing in this. | 185.2
A tunnel is being built about 30 meters below. That tunnel is 21 kilometers long | 189.72
and will be the first undersea tunnel in India. The | 193.72
work on the transportation project has also | 196.2
started. | 198.48
Honorable Speaker, work on the Bullet Train project is going on very fast. | 204.319
Yes, I want to ask the Railway Minister whether | 207.84
in the future we are seeing any opportunity to start Vande Bharat train from Valsad, which is the biggest railway station | 211.48
in our Valsad Lok Sabha. | 218.519
Honorable Speaker, right now there are | 222.0
two Vande trains from Mumbai to Ahmedabad.  Bharat Train is there and it comes | 224.879
touching both the Valsads. | 227.76
Apart from this, if there is any need then the | 229.519
honorable MP can meet me and make further arrangements. | 
###
232.4
Honorable Manoj Tiwari ji | 236.99
[appreciation] | 240.68
Thank you, Speaker, you have given me the opportunity to ask questions. | 243.519
Chairman, Sir, the Honorable | 247.2
Minister has answered our question | 249.0
in detail. First of all, I | 252.0
want to congratulate him. | 255.0
From 2009 to 2014, our Delhi had an average budget of Rs 96 crore. | 259.88
This time he has | 262.36
given a budget of Rs 2582 crore.  I | 265.84
want to thank the Minister for this, | 268.72
Dil Mange Peacock, good work is being done, then we | 272.039
want something else. We want to know from the Minister | 275.0
whether any such scheme or survey has been | 278.16
done in which Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, | 281.199
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Bengal would have become | 284.72
Bullets.  If there is any plan to run a train, | 287.72
I would like to know from the Minister. | 
###
289.56
Honorable Speaker, please get information about it. Honorable Speaker, as the Bullet | 293.44
Train is a committee, | 299.759
how to assimilate the entire technology in India, | 302.199
I | 304.36
would like to tell the whole country through you, Honorable Speaker, Honorable Speaker.  I | 307.12
would also like to tell the MPs many | 310.24
things about the design of Bullet Train, which | 313.44
initially had to be learned from outside, such as the 40 | 317.4
meter single piece girder and the | 320.919
crane to lift it. Honorable Speaker, | 324.479
I would like to say with great satisfaction.  That today the | 330.479
entire structure of that crane has started being made in India in a self-reliant India, | 334.039
similarly there are many more | 339.039
elements in it, so now the | 341.8
entire focus of this entire project is to first | 344.16
understand and assimilate the entire technology and be | 347.68
proud of the engineers of India.  The | 350.72
way the Honorable Prime Minister | 355.8
gave us a glorious place through Vande Bharat and created a medium to become self-reliant, in the | 359.0
same spirit in Bullet Train also we | 362.759
can understand the entire technology, assimilate it and | 365.56
develop it in India.  The | 368.56
focus | 369.639
is on that  | 
###
375.65
Honorable Shri Ravindra [Music] | 377.919
Vaikar | 381.319
Sir Sir | 384.5
[Praise] | 386.18
[Music] | 391.12
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ask a question, | 393.36
Mr. Speaker, the | 395.68
Kokan Railway runs in Maharashtra which is still on a single track, | 398.68
due to which many people are affected during rainy season.  Bar | 401.56
train gets cancelled. Application for | 404.12
track doubling of 350 kilometers was also submitted by Kokan Rail to the Railway Board | 406.639
which is | 409.72
pending since last one year. Minister Sir, I | 412.84
want to ask a Pacific question. | 415.36
I have a question for the Minister. In view of the Kokan Rail, the | 419.12
government | 422.4
When will you take the decision to convert it into doubling track | 425.24
so that | 427.68
Vande Bharat trains between Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa and Kerala can operate on this route?  | 
###
432.72
Honorable MP Madan has asked a very important | 435.8
question. Speaker, Kokan Railway | 439.039
Corporation is a corporation in which the | 441.919
Government of India.  This is a joint venture project of these five governments, Maharashtra Government, Goa Government, | 446.12
Karnataka Government and Kerala Government | 453.199
and there are many important | 456.36
works in it because Kankan Railway is a project connecting from Mumbai | 460.24
all the way up to Bangalore and also down to Kerala.  This is an | 465.919
important project which | 467.599
connects the entire Western Konkan region. | 469.84
In this, the work of these five | 472.12
governments together is the work of doubling the tunnel. The | 478.919
work of the expansion of the tunnel is the work of completely replacing the truck. | 481.919
Governments have to | 484.319
work together, I will | 486.599
definitely discuss it in detail with the Honorable MP | 489.759
and how to take this project | 492.12
forward, he should make arrangements on it, | 
###
500.319
want to say Shri Mann Kam Tagore Mann Kam Tagore, | 503.8

[Praise] | 530.399
Member Honorable Speaker | 533.279
Sir Honorable Minister has | 535.92
given detailed information | 537.279
and | 540.12
after becoming the Minister, there will definitely be | 542.56
a  I | 545.92
thank them very much and | 548.56
congratulate them for the speed that has come in Savikaar Kantri, but the condition of internet in the villages | 554.44
is that currently in my Lok Sabha constituency, | 561.839
internet is available only in about 60 gram panchayats and in 40 per cent its | 565.279
arrangement is not good.  Honorable Chairman, | 569.44
I want to request the Honorable Minister. Has | 576.36
any | 579.76
agency been appointed for regular monitoring and maintenance? In the | 583.04
information I had received, the officials | 585.399
informed that it is done through chips. | 588.24
Monitoring and maintenance used to be done but | 591.04
now it has been closed for the last one year and since last one year, since the | 594.8
Panchayat Secretaries of the Panchayat, | 599.44
our Anganwadi sisters of Women and Child Development as | 602.44
well as the employment assistants have been | 607.279
upgraded in many central and state schemes.  If this has to be done, | 610.079
then it is causing a lot of trouble, for that | 612.76
I want to know from the Honorable Minister, has | 617.88
any agency been appointed for monitoring and maintenance for this? | 620.48
Honorable Minister, please take a minute, Honorable | 623.72
Minister, | 625.32
I am requesting all of you ministers. | 628.399
I am | 629.839
a member's answer, a full minister, half a | 633.32
minister, half a minister, | 636.14
[music] | 636.78
[applause] | 639.2
No, Speaker, | 641.88
your decision will be followed. I | 645.079
want to thank our honorable member | 
###
648.079
who has raised a very important question of | 650.399
Digital India. Prime Minister  It is the | 655.6
resolve of the Government of India under the leadership of Narendra Modi ji that | 660.24
every citizen should get digital access, along | 664.6
with digital access, every citizen should be included | 668.519
and along with the inclusion of every citizen, there should | 671.399
also be empowerment of every citizen in Digital India | 674.68
and at the same time  Under this, in the last 10 years, | 678.44
mobile connections in the country used to be only 90 | 681.72
crores, today they have become 117 crores | 686.36
and telecom connectivity has been | 689.76
done in 85 countries. | 692.839
Whatever these people are talking about about internet connectivity, | 695.92
they have sitting here and shouting today only. | 700.839
Internet connectivity was given to 25 crore people of our country. | 705.44
Today | 709.399
about 90-93 crore people in the country have | 713.6
got internet connectivity. | 715.839
Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, there has been an increase of about 57 percent | 719.68
and with that our | 723.36
internet speed is 1.3 MPPS. | 727.72
During his time, today the same speed has increased to 107 Mbps | 732.48
so that every person | 735.68
gets internet connectivity. As far as we talk about the price, | 738.839
in his time, 53 paise per | 743.079
minute was charged from one person to talk to another person. | 750.12
In the last 10 years during the tenure of the Prime Minister, | 753.639
this price has come down from 53 paise to only three paise, which | 758.0
means it has fallen to 94 and the same is | 763.839
in the field of data because data has become a | 767.199
need for everyone today, where the | 770.68
cost of GB internet data is at 270.  Today, the | 776.12
cost of internet data has | 779.6
come down to 12 paise, which means there has been a decline of 94 percent | 784.04
and under this, digital transactions | 787.6
in the country were only 160 crores during his time. | 791.56
Today, | 794.04
16100 crore digital transactions take place | 797.959
every year within India and all over the world. | 802.0
About 45% of the digital transactions in the | 806.92
whole world would have happened in India today. It | 810.399
is a miracle of the Prime Minister. On the basis of his leadership, | 813.36
as far as he | 816.68
raised the topic of our | 819.8
Chhattisgarh, he talked about it. It is a bit | 823.12
unfortunate that many states have not | 827.36
implemented Bharat Net. | 830.68
When Congress was in power, there was | 836.92
no internet connectivity in Chhattisgarh. | 839.279
We have decided that | 842.56
even in the state led model, which they had destroyed in phase two, | 849.32
internet facility will be provided to every person by creating a monitoring agency.  It | 852.24
is the responsibility of the Government of India to deliver it | 855.32
and | 858.68
Vijay Baghel ji will take the responsibility of implementing it. Supplementary | 865.16
Sir, till when will it be possible for the | 869.56
Gram Panchayat to run smoothly, | 872.88
I would like to request information about it from the Honorable Minister. | 877.48
Speaker Sir, where he | 881.05
[Music] | 883.92
Chhattisgarh  The state has | 888.399
not done this properly, as | 891.759
many of our villages are left in the entire country. An | 900.639
amount of Rs. 4 thousand crores was given by the Government of India for the | 904.759
investment of Bharat Net Phase One and Phase Two. We had 13 such | 909.519
states.  13 states worked on the basis of their state led model. A | 913.56
state like Gujarat has | 917.16
done very good work where there was a shortage. | 921.68
Rest of our Gram Panchayats are 300 Gram Panchayats in the entire country. | 930.16
2000 Gram Panchayats are on the basis of Bharat Net Phase One and | 934.199
Bharat Net Phase Two.  But the | 937.68
rest of our Gram Panchayats which have been connected, a total of | 942.079
164000 Gram Panchayats, have been included under the Amended Bharat | 945.92
Net Scheme and where there are shortcomings, for | 949.44
example, in the area of ​​our MP, a | 957.399
scheme of Rs 129000 crore has been added by the Prime Minister under the | 961.04
Amended Bharat Net Scheme.  It is done | 963.959
under the Project Monitoring Unit and | 966.72
we will ensure that it is criminogenic. We are | 969.68
confident that  |

Mr. MP [Applause] | 974.959
Kova Shri Nav Charan | 977.33
[Music] | 978.45
[Applause] | 982.279
Maji Sir, my Mar Parliament Constituency which | 987.8
is also the home district of Mr. President. | 991.56
I express my gratitude to the Honorable Minister | 994.8
that today we are getting the facility of Fuzzy. | 998.24
Speaker Sir, Mayur is a tribal | 1002.199
area. There are many such places even today | 1006.079
where the network is not available. The government is | 1009.839
considering something for this. | 1012.92
Network can reach such remote areas. | 1016.279
After the communication revolution, | 1019.0
smartphones have reached every village, | 1022.6
but due to lack of cheap internet system, | 1027.16
people are not able to get full benefit of it. I | 1029.839
hope that a special attention will be paid to | 1033.24
Mayurbhanj, the home district of His Excellency the President. | 1036.24
Keeping in mind that | 1040.319
with the availability of modern facilities like internet etc., the | 1043.959
poor and backward tribal brothers and sisters of our district will | 1051.6
get the opportunity to come into the mainstream of development and they will be able to contribute their full efforts in the development of the nation. | 1059.2
Thank you, Sir, I | 1062.16
would like to thank you.  To the MP Sir, | 1063.919
Orissa is a very important state. Today, | 1069.64
if we look at the internet connectivity in Orissa, | 1073.48
overall around | 1077.919
2.5 crore | 1079.559
people in Orissa have internet connectivity, which is | 1083.159
around 50% internet penetration. | 1086.72
50% internet penetration is | 1090.88
happening.  About 99 percent penetration has been done | 1095.12
in urban areas and about 45 | 1099.84
percent internet connectivity has been done in rural areas, | 1103.0
which I just | 1106.28
answered in the previous question. Orissa is also a state, | 1110.6
Mr. Speaker, where the state government has done | 1114.24
this on the basis of Bharat Net 2.  It was decided that | 1118.44
we will implement Bharat Net 2 ourselves | 1121.32
and on the basis of that implementation inefficiency, the | 1125.159
connectivity given to each village has been | 1130.4
given in a linear form and | 1133.36
I want to explain this to the honorable member | 1135.64
when the linear form  In India, | 1139.24
villages are connected to Gram Panchayat. If a | 1142.64
wire gets cut in between, then all the villages in that line get | 1146.159
cut off, whereas | 1149.039
on the basis of modernity, it was necessary to | 1154.08
provide connectivity in ring | 1156.64
form.  It is given that if | 1159.4
the connectivity is broken from one side, then the | 1162.36
connectivity of the village from the other side remains continuous. | 1164.88
Odisha government had not taken this decision, | 1169.24
hence today we have decided that | 1172.6
wherever there are villages in our country, | 1176.76
linear technology will be used.  It was announced that | 1179.36
through the amended Bharat Net program, | 1182.76
we will connect all the villages in ring format on the | 1186.6
basis of a plan of Rs. 1 crore thousand crores | 1190.64
so that connectivity remains continuous, access is always there, | 1194.559
empowerment is always there for the common people, | 1199.08
this plan is always fully inclusive through implementation | 
###
1222.0
and  There is telephone connectivity but there are | 1229.96
hundreds of such villages in our Gachar Chimar Lok area which do not have connectivity | 1233.88
and are deprived of connectivity, hence that | 1237.36
communication is not possible. Through the PDS system, | 1240.4
you are given 5 kg of free food grains from the ration shop | 1244.24
and the rest of the food grains are given through PDS system.  Food | 1247.84
grains are available under the security law, | 1250.6
they are not given without putting a thumb on the machine, | 1254.4
but due to lack of internet connectivity, the | 1259.52
members of your party are asking, you are | 1262.799
not allowing them to speak, the honorable members of your party are | 1265.919
asking questions, you are not allowing them to speak. | 1268.559
This method is not right for them, Honorable Minister | 1271.039
Sir, Garh Chari is very important, | 1276.36
people of your party are asking questions and you are | 1278.76
not allowing them to speak, this method is not right for them, | 1282.48
nor is this method right, | 1286.279
Sir, Gauli is a very important area, | 1291.159
Sir, Maratha of my Maharashtra.  Being that | 1295.799
I also have an emotional | 1297.96
attachment to this area, | 1301.88
our rural | 1305.799
connectivity in all the villages in Maharashtra is today | 1309.279
around 90 percent in Maharashtra, | 1313.44
more than 100 percent in urban areas and | 1315.88
around 52 percent in rural areas. | 1319.32
With this, there are | 1324.279
about 5.5 lakh villages in our entire country. | 1327.64
Speaker, and out of 65 lakh villages, | 1331.799
about 6 Haj villages | 1337.36
are connected with internet and mobile connectivity. Along | 1340.679
with this, today in Maharashtra we have | 1344.6
Total Gram Panchayat Bharat Net Phase 2: | 1348.84
53 We have taken 500 kilometers of optical | 1353.48
fiber cable and about | 1357.679
9500 of our Gram Panchayats have become completely | 1361.159
internet capable, but there are many | 1365.039
villages which are still deprived of this facility.  There are | 1370.96
approximately 24000 such villages in the entire country to | 1374.679
connect them with mobile phones and to | 1378.039
connect them with the internet. The | 1381.32
Prime Minister has taken out a special package | 1384.12
of Rs 22000 crores and | 1389.72
on the basis of this package of Rs 22000 crores, all the villages in the country | 1393.32
Will be connected with mobile inside and the | 1401.08
entire amount has been given on the basis of Universal Service Obligation Fund on the basis of US OA Fund to provide | 1405.0
complete connectivity to these 22000 villages | 1410.08
which | 1412.279
also includes Gadchiroli district, | 1415.52
Honorable Deputy Leader of Opposition, your members.  You are | 1419.36
asking valid questions, you are stopping him, | 1422.76
this is not right to stop him, this way is | 1427.08
not right, don't stop him, everyone has freedom of speech, | 1430.32
you are going to stop him, do | 1433.36
n't do this, this is the house, you stop anyone in the house, | 1438.48

Thank you very much, | 1480.919
Mr. Speaker, for the first | 1485.2
time in the history of independent India, work has been done at such a rapid pace in the development of railways, | 1489.039
currently at a cost of Rs. 2 lakh crores | 1496.49
[Praise] | 1499.2
Kilometers of railway projects are going on. | 1502.44
I will thank the Honorable Prime Minister and the Honorable Railway | 1504.399
Minister. In our Madhya | 1507.0
Pradesh, Lalitpur Siri Railway line which is | 1510.64
under construction for a very long time and its work has | 1513.64
not been completed yet, from Satna to Nagaud | 1517.52
Panna, Khajraho and Rewa.  From Sidhi Sili or two | 1523.32
sections, both the works have not been completed yet. | 1526.32
I will ask the minister by when will they | 1529.679
complete the work. The second topic was the matter of shifting of the Bal Godown of our Satna Railway | 1534.039
Station which is within the city. | 1537.159
In Kama, the work on that has also been done till | 1540.559
now.  It could not be done and our station was among the world class | 1543.279
railway stations which are going to be built, the | 1545.76
work on that too has not started yet, | 1548.44
I want to know from the Minister by | 1551.84
when will all these works be started, | 1554.48
Honorable Speaker, by the way the | 1558.559
question was related to Maharashtra | 1560.919
but  The question asked by the Honorable MP Sir, | 1563.039
Lalitpur Singrauli, this project is | 1569.399
a very important project for the entire Madhya Pradesh, that is why the | 1571.64
Honorable Speaker ji paid great attention to it by | 1575.399
coordinating with the state government. Its three | 1579.559
major issues were the issue of land acquisition and | 1581.72
forest.  The issue of approval of the | 1598.159
project and the issue of taking special prick for going through the Wildlife Sanctuary, all three issues have been resolved. The work is going on at a fast pace now. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to present before you this information for the Honorable MP Sir about the project.  For this, a | 1605.64
suction of Rs 850 crore has been allocated in this year's budget. | 1608.84
This will give a lot of speed to this project. | 1611.32
Honorable MP mentioned the Satna project, | 1614.6
its | 1617.24
suction was done just some time ago, now the | 1620.36
DPR is being prepared in the DPR.  I | 1623.36
would also request the Honorable MP Sir, if it is | 1626.279
his home area, then come and | 1629.679
give your suggestions and Honorable Speaker, | 1633.0
in almost every station, it has been kept in mind that the station should be developed | 1637.279
according to the culture of the city | 1640.08
and that is what I would like to request you. | 1642.76
I will also request you to give | 1645.2
your inputs in that design whenever you come |

Honorable Aksh ji, under the able leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, | 1667.72
a bright future of green energy is in front of us in India | 1674.05
[appreciation] | 1677.12
[Music]  ] | 1679.64
Satisfied with that, a lot of progress has been made by the Government of India | 1684.72
in the one year anniversary of taking up this mission from 2023. | 1694.36
I thank the Minister. My question is what will the | 1702.2
Central Government do in this mission after the announcement of its first Green | 1705.24
Hydrogen Policy. | 1714.799
What facilities are being provided by private and government owned companies for setting up hydrogen producing projects? | 1718.279
This is my first question. | 1723.399
Sir, first of all, | 1731.039
I am really thankful to the noble member for asking the question. | 1733.48
Hello, I also thank you, a | 1745.72
question has been raised for the first time in both the Houses of Parliament on Green Hydrogen, hence Star Queen, | 1748.64
therefore, thank you | 1751.039
and Green | 1754.279
Hydrogen Green Porten, Energy | 1759.36
Lapse, Letter One | 1764.93
[appreciation] | 1776.6
Sarnet also wants to say this.  Ever India | 1779.399
Independence: After India became independent, | 1783.0
whatever technological adoption or | 1786.279
updation there is in the country, from vaccine | 1789.519
to green hydrogen, before this | 1797.039
we used to do it together after 7080 years, but | 1801.64
I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji.  I | 1804.279
offer my thanks to the advanced countries of the world, | 1807.84
when they started the work on Green Hydrogen, | 1810.679
before that the | 1815.12
work was done in India under the leadership of Modi ji. Sir, that | 1818.0
is why I especially thank the Prime Minister | 1820.36
and in this we | 1825.36
National Green Hydrogen  Make a total of 19744 in the mission. | 1830.48
For that, we have | 1834.76
made a site | 1838.76
program for the National Green Hydrogen Mission. So, in the Strategic Intervention | 1841.96
for Green Hydrogen Transition | 1845.24
program, we have made allocation. There are | 1849.32
two components in this allocation, one component is | 1858.2
green for electrolyzer manufacturing.  Hydrogen is produced in two ways, | 1861.399
one is by | 1865.6
electrolysis, by breaking water and by biomass, that | 1869.159
is why we have kept two components in it. | 1872.279
Sir, this is very important. Sir, I | 1874.919
ask for a minute of your time. Sir, in component one, | 1878.279
we | 1883.08
We have allocated Rs 444 crore for electro manufacturing in one site program | 1888.12
and Rs 1350 crore for green hydrogen production in component two | 1895.36
and we have | 1899.2
not sat peacefully just by keeping the money, it is | 1902.6
acceptable under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. | 1905.799
Under his guidance, already | 1909.2
site component one in tranche one has | 1914.039
enum on 1500 MW awarded to a company for | 1917.159
DC | 1918.44
electrolyzer sir, work has started sir, | 1921.279
award has been done sir and second enum | 1927.24
on MW in trench one we have received 23 bit enum | 1933.0
sir.  It is going to be finalized very shortly | 1936.0
sir and the company engaged in production of 4 tonnes of green hydrogen in branch one in mode one should be | 1947.96
awarded. Sir, when the world is | 1951.6
producing, India is also producing. For | 1954.639
this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi | 1957.919

ss sir, I have a topic | 1987.519
from the honorable minister.  From the answer it seems that by 201 we will | 1992.639
achieve net zero, we are ahead of the | 1997.6
green hydrogen project but the | 2001.559
opposition is | 2004.6
talking about the production of green energy. At | 2006.48
present the | 2009.159
opposition party has talked about the production.  Contrary to this, | 2014.08
their work is only to destroy this energy. | 2017.24
Honorable Speaker, I | 2021.559
want to ask the Minister that our Assam | 2024.72
North-East is full of water and Vayu Mats | 2029.24
is full, does the government have any special intention to set up a green hydrogen project in the North-East? | 2035.32
Akanksha Special | 2039.9

and I request you, this is the wrong | 2086.639
way, wrong tradition, you are not able to run the House like this, | 2090.56
you are not going to run the House in a planned manner.  You | 2093.32
want to create a deadlock. You | 2095.639
raised all the issues that you | 2099.96
raised. | 2102.64
If no one believes it, you do not have any | 2106.68
issues. You want to create a deadlock in the House through a planned method. | 2110.48
Parliamentary Affairs Minister will not do|

Aksh sir, the opposition's attitude in | 2116.68
today's situation.  I | 2119.68
want to refute what the Congress Party is doing in the House, Mr. | 2124.079
Rahul Gandhi and the entire Congress Party in the morning and | 2127.119
evening keep on talking about caste and caste and | 2131.079
raising questions on asking about caste here, the | 2135.24
Congress Party has done such a thing today to | 2139.32
weaken the country.  To do this, I want to | 2142.92
tell this House through you, Sir Speaker, that the | 2146.52
Congress Party, first of all, has | 2154.04
made statements against the army of our country to break the country and to | 2158.2
weaken the morale of the army, the Congress Party has | 2161.56
taken steps.  Sir, they have worked to | 2164.76
weaken our democracy, to create | 2171.119
anarchy in the country, to create violence, | 2174.72
and they are | 2178.079
disturbing the Congress party from the streets to the Parliament to | 2181.44
weaken our country. | 2183.92
Sir, I want to say through you that | 2187.119
we will follow the rules of the House, we will | 2190.599
follow the rules and regulations, this Congress party | 2193.64
also violates what was decided in the BSC, | 2196.359
