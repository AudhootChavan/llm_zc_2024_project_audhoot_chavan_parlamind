Honorable Speaker | 317.03
[applause] | 318.8
Sir, the welfare of the farmers, you are the Minister. | 323.319
Yes, Honorable Speaker, | 325.88
Sir, the farmer is a provider of food, | 330.72
he fills the stores of others | 332.919
and gives life to others, therefore, the farmer | 337.88
is also a giver of life and the only goal | 342.12
of our government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is | 349.16
how to make the farmer happy, | 353.479
how to solve his problems, Honorable Speaker. | 356.68
For us, service to farmers is more than worshiping God | 360.919
and in this spirit, | 367.24
this | 369.12
government is taking many measures under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. One of them is to | 377.479
increase the production of farmers and I am happy to say that the | 381.44
efforts of the Prime Minister are | 389.96
I am happy to tell you that Honorable | 391.68
Speaker | 393.759
Sir, today our agricultural growth rate | 397.16
is around 4 per cent, but | 400.72
after abundant production of food grains or fruits and vegetables, | 405.16
a problem arises and that is the problem of  Due to | 410.599
lack of proper storage, | 413.919
we know that for many years, | 417.599
other governments, | 420.44
but neither bar houses were | 423.24
built, nor ripening centers were built, nor were cold | 426.84
storages | 428.199
built, nor were proper arrangements for grading and siting made | 431.639
and Prime Minister Narendra | 434.8
Modi ji helped a | 437.639
lot of farmers.  A big step was taken in this interest | 441.319
and that was to create an Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. | 445.759
I am happy to tell you that the | 452.319
scheme of Agro IFA Fund of Rs. 1 lakh crore was brought by Prime Minister | 456.919
Narendra Modi and as the Honorable | 460.84
Member Shri G. | 466.56
Purushottam Rupala Ji, Honorable Speaker | 470.36

I want to tell you, Honorable | 477.0
Speaker | 477.96
Sir, | 480.479
under the scheme so | 482.479
far in the entire country which includes about 31 states, | 488.0
Honorable Speaker Sir, a total of | 493.879
7222 structures costing Rs | 498.36
7305 crore have been built in the entire country, | 502.599
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra.  It has also been made in Uttar | 506.159

Telangana, Karnataka, Gujarat, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, | 512.88
West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, | 515.12
Orissa, Kerala, Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand, | 520.68
Jammu Kashmir, Himachal Delhi, Goa, | 523.68
Chandigarh, Tripura, and proper storage arrangements are being made all around | 527.279
and | 529.72
due to this, farmers are getting affordable prices.  But | 532.48
he does not have to sell his produce whenever he wants, he | 535.2
keeps it in cold storage or he | 537.92
keeps it in the warehouse and sells it when he gets a fair price. | 540.959
This | 544.32
is a big step towards making farming a profitable business for the farmer. | 546.6
Honorable Chairman Sir, whose  Farmers of the entire country are taking benefits. | 
###
551.6
Honorable Speaker, Sir, I | 556.24
express my gratitude to the Agriculture Minister that he has given | 558.88
detailed information about this subject. Do | 561.44
n't ask questions in detail. You can ask questions in short. I | 562.88
will ask in one line, Sir, that the | 566.36
Prime Minister has given information to | 567.92
our farmers.  The issue of making Annadata as well as | 572.72
energy provider has been raised and it has been resolved that | 580.959
what progress has been made in the same direction under this scheme, I would like to know from you, | 
###
584.839
Honorable Speaker | 587.839
Sir, Prime Minister is a very visionary leader, | 591.88
he has resolved that Annadata | 596.839
Made energy donor and Kusum Yojana | 601.12
which has three components Kusum A, Kusum B | 606.8
and Kusum C. In Kusum A, if | 611.8
someone wants to generate electricity by laying solar panels on barren land, then he can do so | 620.12
under Kusum B. | 624.59
[Praise] | 630.92
Under Kusum B scheme, Honorable Chairman, | 633.64
he can also make arrangements for his irrigation by installing solar panels in his field | 641.32
and if he wishes, he | 644.24
can also get the benefits of electricity batch by supplying the generated electricity to the grid | 649.519
and under Kusum C scheme, Honorable | 652.88

also make arrangements for irrigation of his fields by installing solar panels. | 659.48

673.16
Manish Jaiswal | 677.75
[Praise] | 679.32
Mr | 681.24
Speaker, I express my gratitude to the Honorable Agriculture Minister and the | 685.88
Prime Minister for the | 691.92
relief they have given to the farmers under the Agriculture Infrastructure Scheme, | 694.8
but I have a suggestion to | 700.12
convey this suggestion to the Honorable Minister through you.  I want that | 706.04
tomatoes are cultivated a lot in selective areas like our Jharkhand. Dada, we are | 710.639
talking about the farmer, Dada, respect us a | 715.32
little. We are talking about the farmer, | 717.72
respect us, Dada, his | 720.16
president. | 721.61
Appreciation] | 724.36
Sir, I have requested you earlier also, I have | 727.6
also requested the honorable members, | 729.72
especially the honorable ministers, if anyone is | 731.519
sitting and making any comment, | 734.079
you should not respond to it and | 736.639
why should the honorable member also respond?  Ask questions | 738.6
directly: Which of my people have such habits? Their habits | 742.88
cannot be improved. [ | 745.0
Praise] | 750.079
In short, such people are called Sir, President, Sir, | 753.279
I have | 756.6
not said for you, I have not said for you, | 759.48
President, who are selective.  Area is like | 763.24
here in Jharkhand and especially | 765.279
in Hazaribagh, tomato cultivation and coriander | 768.88
cultivation are very important. At present the self-lying | 772.32
head item of tomato is very less, in such a situation, if the | 776.36
individual farmer, if he | 778.76
is a group of small farmer farmers,  If their | 781.48
small cold storages are incorporated in this, | 784.399
then such | 786.88
farmers will be greatly benefited, Mr. Chairman. Also, | 789.48
I want to add one more word | 792.279
that Mr. | 794.72
Chairman, you have made provision for solar pump in Kusum Yojana. | 797.16
If along with-  Along with this, if there is a provision for boring, if | 800.76
borewells also become a part of it, | 804.199
then farmers will get immense benefits. Chairman | 806.839
Sir, this is what I want to demand through you. | 810.92
Thank you very much  | 
###
814.56
Honorable Chairman Sir. As I told, | 817.48
cold storage can be constructed under this scheme. | 820.72
That construction can also be done by private investors, | 825.519
FPOs can also be done by groups of farmers, | 829.079
Self Help Groups can also be done by | 832.399
individual. If a very small farmer wants to do | 834.759
cold storage, it will not prove to be that profitable business for him, | 837.079
but there are enough arrangements in it so that the | 839.72
farmers can do it.  A group of FPOs | 842.079
can also set up such cold storages in which | 844.199
farmers can keep their tomatoes safe. | 
###
847.16
Rest of the honorable members have given some of their suggestions. | 851.24
We should consider them as much as possible. | 855.12
Sudeep Bandu Pay | 858.32
ji Shiv Chauhan ji, we are with you from the Lok Sabha. | 863.36
Members were with me in Kopu, | 867.88
I am happy to see you Union Minister today. I | 871.32
want to tell you one question. I want to tell you one question. | 874.6
You talk about coal storage. | 877.32
For the farmers, they will | 880.639
go to the coal storage and will keep the goods for a long time. | 884.04
Shares of coal storage in  The whole of the country is extreme | 887.399
in number. Farmers | 891.6
increase their production to go for distress sale | 895.0
and due to lack of coal in storage, they have to | 900.0
go to the market and do distress sale. It | 907.839
costs two rupees to make one kg of patto.  In the de sale, the | 913.279
reason for not getting space for coal storage in the market is that it should be sold for one rupee. | 916.36
I want to know that the Government of India should give a pass to the minister to fill up the need of the farmers to | 919.44
increase the coal storage setup in the entire country. | 926.519
What | 930.36
position have you taken, | 
###
931.88
Honorable Speaker | 934.8
Sir, I respect Bandopadhyay ji very much, he is | 937.88
my old friend, | 940.839
we have been together in the Parliament and I | 943.68
also respect his talent. Honorable | 946.48
Speaker | 947.519
Sir, it is true that in the last many years, the | 951.519
cold store | 955.199
Governments have not taken any steps for a system like coal storage | 958.56
even after 10 years and due to this | 963.519
such situations have arisen but now the | 966.6
work of construction of cold storage is | 971.16
going on at a fast pace even under this scheme and | 975.199
hence at various places.  I had just read the list of states in | 977.36
front of you, cold storages are also being | 980.639
constructed under this scheme and as | 983.68
I said, the scheme of Agriculture IFFA Fund will | 986.68
continue till 3233, wherever there are gaps, | 991.44
cold storages will also be constructed under this scheme. |

ji Prashant | 1003.519

gave me the opportunity to speak, through you | 1011.56
I would like to ask a question to the Minister, | 1019.56

grid connector solar power plant were | 1025.959
installed in the country under the PM Kusum scheme?  And how much electricity is produced in it? | 1034.4
Honorable Speaker | 1037.079
Sir, Kusum | 1039.039
Yojana has just started. I will | 1041.6
take complete information and give |

Ask one question, ask one question, after that I will | 1191.159
sit in a bonfire. Honorable Minister, | 1194.0
Honorable Speaker, sit down. The question asked by the member, you sit down, | 1199.48
you answer the | 1202.919
question asked by the honorable member, to | 1205.559
increase the wages on MNREGA | 1208.84
and  To provide labour, I want to make it very clear | 1212.159
that in the last 10 years when there | 1215.32
was UPA government, during their time only Rs 2 | 1220.36
crores | 1223.36
were released and if you look at the 10 years under the leadership of our popular Prime Minister respected | 1226.2
Modi ji,  The | 1233.88
work of giving 737 thousand crore rupees in this fund has been increased by almost 2 times. | 1236.88
Speaker Sir, as far as the | 1240.88
member has expressed concern that the wages | 1245.0
should be increased, I want to say this very clearly | 1247.48
that the | 1250.88
CPI of our MNREGA is an institution.  Through which it | 1255.28
assesses it every year from time to time and | 1258.679
increases it wherever it deems appropriate. | 1260.919
I would like to bring to their notice that | 1263.4
in the last five years, if we | 1266.799
look at the data, there has been an increase of about 43% in wages, | 1269.72
so it is  If | 1272.4
we look at it per year, then there is an increase of about 7 per cent in the number of | 1275.08
our laborers every year | 1277.12
and the statement of respected Prime Minister Modi ji | 1279.159
is that we must give 100 days of work under MNREGA to | 1284.159
our poor people who are | 1286.88
willing to work.  There are people in the same village, | 1289.4
we work to provide them employment, | 1292.4
very many members, | 1296.039
all of them, | 1298.559

Rasad Vik A Nirva | 1312.44

Minister, I have already said that our | 1336.159
government is the President, Sir.  We have already told the | 1339.559
honorable member that our | 1341.76
government is committed to provide 100 days of work | 1344.159
and there is no question of any reduction | 1349.48
and as far as the member is concerned about | 1353.159
increasing the working days, I | 1355.88
want to make it very clear.  Whatever demand the respected Modi ji's | 1359.36
government makes, be it | 1362.44
financial or any work, our government will | 1365.76
work to provide it in that village and secondly, I | 1369.36
want to make it clear that | 1373.36
whatever demand the state government makes for 100 days' work, the | 1377.6
Government of India will fulfill it.  Will do the work of giving | 1380.36
Thanks |

that it is not a matter of our power in the Nagar Panchayat and Municipality, | 1437.919
but I would definitely | 1440.52
like to bring to the notice of the member that | 1445.12
under the leadership of respected Prime Minister Modi, there are many such schemes of our government | 1448.2
in which the Prime Minister can  Be it Swa Nidhi Yojana, | 1450.039

many such skill development schemes | 1456.039
on which our government is | 1457.919
working from the employment point of view. | 
###
1464.039
Thank you very much sir, State of | 1469.08
Tamil Nadu has about 90 lakh people | 1471.84
participating in it.  MNREGA works had | 1474.399
requested allocation for 40 crore person | 1477.24
days for | 1479.2
2324 but I would like to ask through you the | 1482.72
minister it was sanction funds for only 28 | 1486.64
crore person days sir so what is the rationale of | 1490.399
the government behind such a smaller allocation | 1493.279
to a tamilnadu state  And I would like to know through | 1497.039
you whether the Minister considers this and | 1499.96
plans to increase the same in the coming time Sir. | 1502.679

is the responsibility and duty | 1543.2

mandatory duty of the Central Government | 1552.48
to provide 100 days work it is not anybody | 1556.919
sir anybody  Choose | 1559.159
it to be done and if it has not been | 1564.96
provided then it has not been correct that ever | 1569.44

but especially for the West | 1578.279
Bengal political bias has been adopted by the | 1581.88

###
1591.88
Honorable Speaker | 1595.6
Sir, it is | 1598.6
our commitment that it is | 1602.76
not necessary to ask for 100 days employment, even if they do | 1606.08
not ask for 100 days employment, to provide | 1610.039
100 days | 1611.44
employment to a family if they ask for it and hence | 1615.159
Honorable Speaker | 1616.6
Sir, many families ask for 50 days of employment, | 1619.919
some ask for 60 days of employment, | 1622.679
but they are given employment for the number of days they ask for | 1625.679
and I am saying that | 1628.52
it is Narendra Modi ji's government | 1632.559
which has increased the allocation three times.  This | 1636.52
year also a provision of Rs 86 crore has been made | 1640.2
and if there is a | 1643.6
need and demand then | 1648.44
that provision will be increased further, | 1652.399
but Honorable Speaker Sir, I | 1655.2
want to say with great humility that this scheme | 1658.76
is to provide employment to the laborers.  For this, the | 1662.519
Prime Minister has also said that a late | 1665.279
Prime Minister used to say that if I send one rupee, it | 1668.519
reaches 15 paise, but Narendra Modi ji | 1673.159
said, I will neither eat nor let anyone eat, | 1678.76
if anyone is misusing this scheme, | 1681.64
Amita is working outside the guidelines.  He is | 1685.32
diverting the funds, | 1688.76
changing the name of the scheme, then in such a case | 1692.919
we will not let the public money be consumed, | 1696.32
we will definitely take action against him and West Bengal has | 1699.48
done this by | 1701.72
diverting many Anita, many Amita from West Bengal.  The | 1706.399
name of the scheme has been changed, Honorable | 1709.039
Speaker Sir, FIR has been filed and this | 1713.519
government is working to save the officers | 1716.679
who diverted the funds, hence the money has been blocked. | 1719.72
This money is not for you to earn, this is | 1722.76
money for the laborers to eat. | 1725.96
Honorable | 1728.48

market we are getting enough investment we are | 2083.159
looking people are lining up to set up | 2085.399
manufacturing units there is | 2087.159
technology transfer there is job creation there is | 2089.72
employment there are other MSME | 2093.2
subsidiaries which gain traction because of a | 2096.96
Industry set up So these are the reasons why | 2100.119
we are welcoming it and we are assuring | 2102.359
that mid cost we are opening up PLI | 2104.64
Schemes Question number one One minute we are | 2108.32
also clipping question number 105 | 2111.24
so from question number 105 Rang appa bane | 2114.96
ji thank you  Thank you Sir, | 2117.119
you said question number first, you said | 2120.32
question number 105, you said question number | 2124.48
105, Honorable Member, Honorable Speaker, Honorable | 2129.56
Speaker, | 2137.32
our government had | 2139.76
started PLI scheme in 2020 to make small industries of the country self-reliant. There are 14 main industries in it. | 2144.599
And from the answer given by the | 2148.359
Honorable Minister to make small industries self-reliant, | 2151.96
I | 2155.76
would like to tell the Honorable Minister | 2165.8
what the government is doing to promote small industries in the next five years under this scheme and  From 2020 | 2171.44
till now, the information I need about this scheme in every state, | 2180.76
I want information about which industries got benefit under this scheme, | 2183.839
state wise, | 2186.56
Honorable Speaker, the question asked by the honorable member | 2190.64
about small industries, | 2194.96
link to PLI Scheme Incentive Scheme.  What | 2197.839
I want to tell the honorable member is | 2202.68
that earlier this scheme was | 2206.0
based on bringing in big companies, but | 2209.599
when big companies come in, then | 2212.359
MSMEs will also grow and under this, | 2215.96
we have seen till now 176 MSMEs have taken part in this | 2220.52
PLI.  The beneficiaries of the scheme are our | 2225.68
plan, it is very ambitious and now | 2229.48
755 applications have been received for it in 10 days. An investment of Rs | 2233.599
1.32 lakh crore has come in 10 departments, | 2236.72
more than 1 lakh | 2240.44
people have got employment and the production | 2244.119
and sales are there.  11 lakh crores has already been made | 2246.319
and these 1300 units seem to have been installed | 2250.4
in 27 states, so | 2254.119
as I said, this is a very ambitious | 2256.64
plan and it is being taken further, we are | 2260.599
getting a very good response which is from the government.  The | 2263.0
aim was to bring industries, | 2266.68
make India self-reliant, | 2270.48
for the growth of our manufacturing sector, the | 2273.28
need for technology transfer is | 2275.4
happening and the value addition | 2278.16
components which used to come from other countries are being | 2281.359
made in India today and this is what I | 2284.599
I want to inform that this is being taken further and this domestic ne|

2287.4
Avi Sawant | 2293.359
ji is not supplementary to that | 2297.68
in the club, Honorable Chairman ji, thank you very much | 2301.68
late r to per i really at the scheme good | 2305.0
scheme definitely but at the same time ya think of | 2307.88
It is our own sectors for example Indian | 2310.76
telecom industry which was | 2312.56
manufacturing our own instruments now why don't you I mean give them | 2314.119
some | 2317.76
incentive so that that also company will come | 2319.839
up but at the same time I would like to ask | 2321.76
you the question the technology transfer is | 2324.4
There the issue is now in the case of China weather | 2328.44
the trading has not started under the | 2330.4
pretext of self rubber the MT BS could | 2333.599
not bring the equipment because of the | 2336.2
diplomatic crisis | 2337.72
now the situation is that under the self sufficient | 2340.839
we are not manufacturing in  India We are | 2342.839
waiting for that and some people MSEB We have | 2345.64
brought the machinery from China but they can | 2348.8
not install it because they know they don't | 2350.96
transfer the technology They ask for person to come and | 2353.48
install Warrior that person is not | 2355.88
getting the visa weather  The Government is | 2357.92
thinking of it to grant the visa for the | 2360.079
people who are coming from China to install | 2362.0
the machinery which has been brought to India | 2364.2
through this trading Kindly Answer the | 2366.079
Question Thank you so much | 
###
2369.2
Thank you Speaker Sir, first of all I | 2374.2
would like to tell that  Over the years, we have | 2377.359
seen that many countries encourage people to | 2380.88
invest | 2384.52
and in India also there was a demand that India has to be | 2388.359
made self-reliant. One of them was that at the time of beginning, the | 2391.839
Indian industry did | 2395.8
not tell us that it would be permanent.  You need support and | 2398.24
permanent subsidy. | 2401.359
While starting the scooter, you start it with a kick. In | 2404.24
a way, the PLI | 2406.8
scheme was created with the view of | 2410.599
how we can help the industry in the initial phase, | 2415.16
which is cost constrained and it is very well thought out.  As | 2418.96
part of the strategy, a committee sat and studied every industry and | 2426.319
identified the potential in India that can be | 2429.599
increased and out of them, 14 sectors were identified. If there are | 2457.359
dhabas in the area, there are hotels, there are | 2460.319
taxi drivers, then an entire | 2462.76
area gets developed. I am happy that | 2466.119
Other states of the country and about 27 | 2469.72
states and union territories took advantage of this, it | 2472.52
also includes Maharashtra, | 2475.48
Telangana, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and | 2479.72
Tamil Nadu. Every state has | 2488.0
attracted people from its sectors where they have their e-policy.  Talking about the telecom | 2490.52
sector, there are PLI units in the telecom sector too. | 2494.119
Many people have invested in the telecom sector too. It is | 2497.16
not necessary that there should be | 2500.839
equal investment in every sector. | 2503.839
Those who have technology want to come to India, | 2507.599
we invite them as per their wish. | 2511.359
And it was widely | 2515.119
publicized all over the world, companies from all over the world | 2518.16
took a lot of interest in it and | 2520.76
I am happy to say that many | 2523.96
things in which we were dependent on neighboring countries, are | 2527.2
now being made in the country. You have given the | 2530.28
example of telecom.  I | 2532.64
would also like to tell about white goods, the previous question was on that, | 2535.599
earlier air conditioners or LED lights were | 2541.16
coming from abroad on a large scale, earlier I was | 2543.88
reviewing it, our guess was that 4 45 | 2547.68
Q. Air | 2550.559
conditioners will become domestic content. I am happy to share them with the House.  It | 2553.599
happened through you that now more than 65% of | 2557.8
air conditioners have Indian made | 2561.319
components and this will increase to 80% | 2566.359
in the next two and a half years. This is the beginning. | 2569.28
Bhadri Mata Ji asked | 2572.2
why did we open many compressors again.  Manufacturers | 2575.839
took advantage of it, many more want to take advantage of it, | 2579.4
then when more component manufacturers | 2582.2
approached, we had some investment left, | 2585.0
some subsidy was left, so | 2588.48
the window was opened one more time so that more people could take advantage of it. | 2591.8
India should be self-reliant. Air conditioner LEDs. | 2595.04
In telecom and this during the time of Covid, | 2598.4
along with the self-reliant India package, this | 2601.28
scheme has made a very important and significant | 2605.359
contribution in making India capable and | 2609.64
as far as visa is concerned, the | 2612.88
company comes under the PLI scheme ordinarily if it has | 2616.92
security  If there is any business transaction which should not be fatal from the point of view, then | 2625.0
provision of visa has been made for those | 2629.119
cases where the cases linked to PLI had | 2632.44
approached DP IT, we would have been proud to work with ME and Home | 2635.0
Ministry to | 2637.8
grant them visa.  | 
###
2642.24
Gog ji, thank you, Chairman, Sir, Minister, they talk about | 2646.2
self-reliance, but the | 2648.68
kind of economic situation they have created, | 2651.4
now India is not self-reliant in the last 10 years | 2654.559
and has become dependent on China. Now | 2657.119
Arvind Sawant ji said that there is a demand for more visas from China. | 2660.04
Ministry is doing this and they are | 2663.079
also giving suggestions to that ministry that | 2666.04
we should get more visas. | 2668.839
What is your question? I | 2670.76
want to ask the minister that the Economic Survey | 2673.4
also wrote the same a few days ago that from China | 2675.76
We should take more FDI, then where the | 2678.8
Foreign Minister says that we | 2681.319
will deal with China with all our might, the | 2684.44
Commerce Minister says that we | 2687.24
need more investment from China, if we want more visas from China, then the | 2690.559
Foreign Minister and Commerce of the country | 2693.8
Why do ministers talk about two different things? Talk about double engine. | 2696.599
Valid member, Congress | 2701.48
ruled this country for 60 years. They are forgetting | 2703.8
how much failure their state was, that India had to | 2707.319
depend on foreign countries. | 2710.48
Recently, last week, the question was raised.  In response, our | 2713.92
ministry had shared with the country that | 2717.52
during the time of Congress, the imports | 2721.359
increased on such a large scale that | 2725.92
where four billion dollars were imported from China, | 2730.4
it increased to about 40-45 billion | 2734.44
i.e. 10  More than double the growth came from China | 2739.48
in their time, whereas the growth in our time was | 2743.16
only two and a | 2745.72
quarter times. We brought it under control, | 2750.44
we made the country self-reliant through different schemes. I | 2757.119
blame UPA for manufacturing in the country.  And today | 2760.96
their name has changed, what do | 2764.04
they say these days, it is 'In Alliance' but this is UP, the | 2768.04
country was weakened during the time of UPA, we still do | 2771.72
not know what that MOU was | 2775.28
with China, which the Congress leaders | 2778.68
did, we do not know till date.  No, what was the | 2782.079
reason for that, India's trade deficit | 2789.04
increased almost four times during the time of UPA and Bharatiya Janata Party | 2794.96
and NDA also put restrictions on China and | 2798.92
also put restrictions on investment. As far as the Chief Economic Advisor is concerned, | 2802.4
he is from an independent report. | 2806.4
His view of that report is that there is no change | 2811.4
in the current situation of the Government of India, the | 2817.76
investments that come from China are | 2822.2
checked under the press note and wherever we do | 2826.319
not feel appropriate, it is stopped. | 2829.28
The policy is still the same |

Sir Ekrat Jo yes 104 number is a question about | 2868.76
my constituency Apna Pahil Asel's | 2871.4
Chandrapur district 444 | 2875.4
Suicides are the highest in the country, in Majha, which is the second | 2878.28
constituency, there were | 2881.319
1641 suicides in Yavatmal district, but till now the | 2884.24
government has not taken any intervention, the | 2887.48
concerned minister Madam Majhi has two | 2890.8
specific questions or points as to whether it is the | 2893.96
families who commit suicide or the | 2896.28
family as a rule.  The only | 2898.76
help given to accept the guardianship of the family is that | 2902.8
we will never give up our rule and will give up the family. | 2905.0

2912.359
Honorable Speaker | 2916.24
Sir, human life is very precious | 2920.48
and if even one unfortunate incident | 2923.88
happens, then it is a matter of trouble for us. | 2925.88
Anyway it was said, Jeeve Sarada | 2929.119
Satam, I want to say that to | 2935.079
save the farmers of the country from such unfortunate situations, | 2943.24
many schemes have been started under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. | 2946.24
Honorable Speaker | 2949.0
Sir, the income of the farmers should be doubled | 2952.799
and for this we have a six-point strategy. | 2958.64
One is to increase the production, second is to reduce the cost of production, third is to | 2963.079
give fair price for the production, fourth, | 2967.76
in case of natural disaster, the government | 2972.72
compensates the loss through schemes like crop insurance and | 2976.96
gives relief, | 2981.599
starting schemes like diversification of crops and natural farming | 2985.72
and that is why I say.  That the | 2989.92
government is fully | 2993.76
committed to the welfare of the farmers, planned efforts are being made to increase the income | 2997.16
and | 3000.92
many efforts have been made to ensure that the farmers get fair prices. |

106 Shri Dharamveer Singh Ji Question No. | 3017.079
106 Honorable Minister | 3019.88
Sir 106 Honorable Minister  Sir, Honorable | 3023.64
Speaker, a statement was placed on the table of the House. | 3025.44
Honorable Member | 3028.079
Speaker | 3029.839
Sir, when I read the complete reply, there is | 3033.76
no doubt that the | 3037.119
budget of the Agriculture Ministry has increased almost no times in comparison to the last 10 years, | 3042.359
yet I want to ask the Honorable Minister. | 3046.92
Because if I talk about today's Haryana state, | 3050.76
they are not farmers, they are | 3052.76
people of big farm houses and farming is every | 3055.88
laborer. Will | 3057.16
that laborer be included in MNREGA | 3059.72
who works in his own fields along with him | 3062.88
because the weather keeps changing?  And | 3066.68
in such weather this time there is very less rainfall | 3069.44
in the state of Haryana, there is almost drought in the state, without water crops | 3072.839
cannot be grown. Will any compensation be | 3075.76
given to the farmer this year and because of the government's | 3078.64
incentive, especially DAP, the one who does not | 3082.24
put urea in his field, will he be given any compensation?  Is there any incentive to give Rs. 00 per | 3085.839
acre to a farmer who uses only organic fertilizers? | 3092.48
Government of India has its | 3098.04
own guidelines for MNREGA, | 3104.16
under which a laborer is given wages if he asks for 100 days of employment. | 3109.119
As far as the | 3114.359
problem of water is concerned, the honorable | 3117.52
learned member would like to submit that | 3123.44
under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, | 3126.92
work is going on on many projects like micro irrigation scheme and | 3132.04
under the micro irrigation scheme, 70 lakh | 3135.72
hectares of new land has been created.  The land has been brought under this scheme | 3139.2
so that maximum irrigation can be done through drip and sprinkler in less water | 3147.64
and the | 3151.079
cost of the farmer can also be reduced and | 3155.28
apart from this I am proud to say that it | 3158.359
is the government of Narendra Modi ji which | 3161.559
Currently, the government is working on projects like River Link. As the | 3166.04
projects have been approved, the | 3168.799
government has made a plan for the provision of water. The | 3172.64
area under irrigation is also being increased. | 3175.2
As far as natural drought | 3178.76
etc. are concerned, when the states send their reports,  If there are any, | 3182.359
then the Central Government sends its team to get the | 3185.319
tests done and the rules and | 3188.44
procedures that work to provide assistance under it, | 3191.52
I salute the farmers of Haryana, | 3194.28
they have filled the stores of others in the country, they | 3197.839
respect them and like the | 3202.04
honorable member.  Said a very important thing | 3205.44
he raised that organic farming type | 3209.119
natural farming will promote it. | 3212.4
I am happy to say that the Natural | 3215.44
Farming Mission is being started under the guidance of the Prime Minister | 3219.52
and gradually | 3225.24
due to the use of more and more chemical fertilizers which  Harm is being caused, it is also affecting the human body | 3227.88
and the | 3230.24
productive capacity of the land is also decreasing and Honorable | 3232.88
Speaker Sir, | 3234.799
we have to keep the earth safe for the coming generations, | 3237.119
hence the government should work on natural farming with full seriousness. | 3240.04
And the provision | 3242.559
of giving subsidy to the farmers doing natural farming is | 3245.52
also being seriously considered so | 3247.799
that the cost can be reduced and | 3250.96
we can get safe products and also the health of the earth. |

Honorable | 3256.359
Member, as the Honorable Minister | 3259.079
said because  We have been hearing for the last 20 years, | 3261.359
Mr. Speaker, that | 3264.119
three dams were to be built on our Yamuna so that | 3266.4
we can get some water. Lakhwar Renuka and Kisah, will the | 3270.04
Government of India tell us that the work will be completed? | 3273.119
Water Resources Minister | 3275.52
Deependra Hooda will tell. | 3277.88
Thank you, Speaker.  Sir, as you | 3282.559
know, there was a big movement in Haryana and Punjab regarding the legal guarantee of MSP | 3285.119
and the withdrawal of the three agricultural laws that had come. | 3292.92
Now the Honorable Minister was saying that he was | 3296.96
also saluting the farmers of Haryana and | 3299.599
Before that, in response to the question, he | 3301.24
said that every human life is precious. The | 3303.76
lives of 750 farmers were sacrificed in this movement, | 3307.04
most of whom were farmers from Haryana, | 3310.119
Punjab, Western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. | 3312.599
I | 3314.76
want to ask a question to the Honorable Minister that when the agreement was reached.  It was | 3318.119
said with the government that these farmers will be | 3320.359
helped, those families whose | 3323.64
livelihood has been lost by the minister | 3326.44
but jobs have not been given to them till now. | 3329.039
Is the government thinking that they will be | 3331.16
given employment in these families? Honorable | 3333.799
Speaker.  Sir, Hari Bhajan was covered with cotton. Head | 3338.92
of this question, this is not a joke, it is | 3342.839
not a joke, this is | 3344.52
not related to this, | 3349.839
still, Honorable Speaker | 3353.119
Sir, I want to say this by asking, Honorable | 3356.68
Minister is replying, Honorable Speaker | 3359.2
Sir.  I want to say firmly that the | 3364.079
government is completely committed to the welfare of farmers, | 3368.4
completely committed and | 3371.599
as far as you are talking about the welfare of farmers, | 3373.319
this is the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at | 3378.599
your time, Honorable Speaker Sir, at your | 3384.76
time.  The report of Swami Nathan Commission came | 3388.359
in 2006 and in that report it was said | 3392.48
that the | 3396.48
minimum support price should be fixed by adding profit at Rs 50 to the farmers' cost. | 3400.799
Their government had refused. | 3403.4
Honorable Speaker Sir did not do it, he | 3405.72
refused to | 3408.28
me.  The document is, Honorable Speaker | 3412.079
Sir, this is the cabinet note which I | 3415.039
placed on the table of Rajya Sabha. | 3417.119
Honorable Speaker Sir clearly denied this. | 3420.359
His minister was Kantilal Bhuria. He | 3423.2
said that profit cannot be added at Rs. 50. | 3426.599
Respected Sharad Pawar ji was the Agriculture Minister. | 3430.319
He also said that  It cannot be given and | 3432.92
Honorable Chairman Sir Tham Saheb also said that it | 3435.44
cannot be given. This is the cabinet note | 3438.359
of his government in which he had said that MSP | 3442.76
production weighted | 3445.16
reception should be at least at 50 and | 3448.96
fixing the increase at 50 will lead to distortion in the market.  This | 3456.119
elephant's tusk, which is meant for | 3459.839
eating and for showing off, has been increased | 3463.76
manifold under the leadership of Honorable Speaker Sir. Under the leadership of Narendra Modi, the | 3467.68
prices of MSP have been | 3470.88
increased manifold. The MSP of millet is basic when it  If we | 3474.52
talk about farmers then it was 1250, we have | 3478.039
increased it to | 3479.359
2625, the | 3481.28
support force of Cha at that time was 1100, we have | 3486.88
increased it to 1850, Jowar Hybrid | 3491.64
1500 to | 3494.44
3371 Maize 1310 to | 3497.4
2225 Paddy 1345 to 2320 Ragi 1500 to | 3504.0
4290 Gram 1400 | 3507.2
275  Na, Honorable Speaker Sir, Honorable | 3512.039
Speaker Sir, 55 Rawal 5500 to | 3517.319
11750 and | 3519.72
listen, Narendra Modi ji's government will buy as much urad, masoor and tur as the farmer produces. During | 3528.799
your time, Honorable Speaker Sir, | 3533.68
how much was purchased during your time, I | 3536.76
want to tell you [praise of dalan] | 3539.57
] | 3540.799
Purchased and I am also tabling this cabinet note in | 3544.359
which he had | 3549.039
said, stabbing the farmer in the back, that giving profit at Rs 50 | 3553.839
cannot be done and Narendra Modi ji | 3557.0
's government has | 3559.24
added profit to the cost at Rs 50 and set the minimum support | 3564.16
price.  There is a restriction on the government, | 3568.319
we will leave no stone unturned in giving fair prices to the farmers. | 3571.2
Honorable | 3572.49
[appreciation] |
