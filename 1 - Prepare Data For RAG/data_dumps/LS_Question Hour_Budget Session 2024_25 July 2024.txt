honorable | 241.84
members should express their views and participate in the discussion inside the House. | 247.079

which is not in accordance with the decorum of the House and is | 256.199
also in accordance with the parliamentary traditions. We and  Let us | 258.919
try to create a high level of tradition in this House and let the | 263.32
people of the party discuss | 266.04
that the honorable members elected in the 18th Lok Sabha have | 270.8
enhanced the dignity of the House, | 272.8

its dignity, enhanced the dignity and prestige of the | 278.24
Parliament of India in the world and the | 281.24
democracy. | 284.039
I would like to request all the honorable members to make such a tradition in the manner in which we have a reputation, | 286.919
we will definitely address such words, | 290.919
but at the same time, | 294.52

and | 319.68
as much as we will maintain the dignity of the House, | 324.0
you will also have the same respect in your respective | 325.96
areas.  It will increase in the number of people who will not speak inside the Parliament. | 330.08

Sir, As | 424.759
far as implementation of this mechanism is concerned. | 429.16
This is a program of Energy Efficiency, the Bureau of Energy | 432.36
Efficiency has published a very detailed | 435.599
procedure in which whether it is the | 439.199
subject of validation, certification or | 441.44
verification, | 443.4
this whole subject is actually a very | 448.879
serious subject | 450.199
and the whole world is concerned about it, so many | 454.759
The parameters are also of the international market and | 457.759
all other countries consider it. | 460.919
In fact, it was first | 467.96
started in 1997 under the Kyoto Protocol. In India too, | 472.599
registration in it started in 2001 and | 477.72
in 2005, its intensity was increased. | 482.0
A method of clean development was created and after that | 486.0
we are continuously | 488.599
doing voluntary participation under the Clean Development Mechanism. | 491.36
Further, our achievements have been increasing continuously and | 494.68
some of our commitments have also been | 498.52
made to the world community and | 500.96
today's topic is under that.  We want to establish a carbon | 503.639
credit market in India. | 505.919
In this regard, we are moving forward. | 510.919
Honorable | 512.08
Member Speaker would like to ask a supplementary. Sir, the Government is | 515.12
interested in blockchain technology and is | 522.919
asking about addressable banking technology. | 534.68
Ask about Block Chan e | 538.44
Being in Registry of Carbon Cut | 541.2
Certificate by Our By Grade Control of | 544.0
India It | 546.839
P | 548.44
Shri Manish Tiwari | 551.48
Ji Thank You Very Much Mr. Speaker Sir With | 556.44
Permission Mr. Speaker Sir I Want to | 558.88
Ask Broader Policy | 561.64
Question Going Back to the  Earth Summit in | 565.72
Rio de Janeiro in 1992 | 570.2
Consensus emerges in the global community that | 575.959
global warming must be limited to 1.5 | 579.92
degrees Celsius and 2.7 degrees above the | 584.88
pre-industrial temperatures observed during | 587.839
the 1500s before the First | 590.48
Industrial Revolution took place now | 593.04
from 1992 onward.  Till | 596.36
2024 This Figure And This Number Has Been The | 602.12
Trigger For A Number Of Regimes Like The Common | 606.36
But Different | 608.92
The National Nationally Determine Voluntary | 614.519
Contribution In The Current Economic Survey I Do | 618.6
Not Know Wether The Minister Has Had The | 621.12
Chance To Read The Current Economic Survey  But there are | 624.56
two chapters related to Energy | 628.399
Transition Chapter 6 and Chapter 30 which are not | 632.68
interesting in Economic Survey The strict | 637.0
sense of 1.5 degree centigrade is that the | 641.92
global temperature should not rise beyond 1.5 | 645.48
degree centigrade has been que in both | 649.88
chapters now this is extremely | 652.72
significant | 653.68
My question to the Minister is if the | 657.92
Government agrees with the assertion that has been made in | 661.24
the Economic Survey and if the Government agrees | 663.92
with the assertion that has been made in the Economic | 666.88
Survey it dictates a large number of the global | 671.959
consensus that has been held in the field and triggered  The | 675.639
CBDR and the National Forest Minister Mr. | 679.32
Chairman, Mr. Joke, studying the Minister, | 683.399
being a Minister, I am proud as you | 685.8
said that I am just one month old tanner of | 690.2
this sauce but overall the topic is so | 693.92
big and is a subject of international concern. | 696.639
Right from 1992 or 1997, the concern has been increasing. | 701.12
We have also made some commitments to the world community | 703.8
and in that commitment, | 707.16
we will reduce it up to the | 709.32
commitment of 2005 i.e. the emissions which were | 712.0
carbon emissions. | 717.48
This was our commitment from 33 to 35 | 721.56
but later we achieved it. In these | 723.839
20 years it was till 2030 but we achieved it. We | 727.32
completed it before the target. | 729.88
So we | 735.48
set ourselves an ambitious target.  Told that we will take it to 45 | 738.12
by 2030, we will reduce carbon emissions. | 741.0
When we reduce carbon emissions, we will | 743.6
definitely achieve the goal of reducing our contribution to global warming, | 748.399
yet this is such a big | 751.88
topic.  Since this is a technical issue, | 753.639
we will definitely sit and have tea | 755.839
and discuss everything. | 758.639
Thank you Honorable Minister, please take a minute. | 762.56
I am telling you that Honorable Minister will | 765.88
never answer during Question Hour. | 768.0
You have given the answer, that is fine, | 770.839
answer after drinking tea | 772.16
[applause] | 777.24
No, I have not said it | 779.73
[Music] | 779.74
[Applause] | 782.16
Mrs. D. Poon | 785.93
[Applause] | 790.78
[Music] | 791.41
[Applause] | 800.519
Goddess and not | 806.199
tired Also | 808.12
report the carbon emissions that they have | 811.8
Organizations that issue the | 814.639
carbon credit should also report the | 816.48
carbon emissions that they have reduced Otherwise there | 820.76
is absolutely no legitimacy we | 823.6
have companies that have to offset their carbon emissions by | 826.44
investing in projects that reduce | 829.48
greenhouse gas emissions So my question | 832.399
to the human  Minister Wood B Is there a | 835.32
tracking system on weather Sach companies are | 838.04
really reducing their own carbon emissions | 840.44
before they invest in projects which are already reduce the | 843.24
carbon emissions I think it also | 845.839
connects to what the question has already been raised Ali | 847.759
thank you sir | 850.0
Minister, Chairman, there are | 853.079
some targets for carbon emission, | 855.72
some targets are given to them, every | 857.32
industry, every sector, out of that, | 860.0
a competition arises as to | 862.199
who fulfills the carbon commission's targets and | 864.519
who achieves them better.  Carbon certificates are issued to those who achieve better | 869.44
so that they | 871.36
can sell in the free market within the market, then when the | 873.639
process of selling and buying starts, then | 875.8
definitely its repair will happen automatically | 878.24
because still our Indian carbon | 880.0
market is the same.  Under the way, | 883.759
when this carbon Indian carb market will be | 885.88
revealed by 2026, one of the evaluation will be that | 888.279
which sector of the industry has fulfilled its target, which has | 891.36
not fulfilled it, those who | 893.839
will fulfill it and will not be able to do so, then they will | 896.72
have to buy certificates which will complete it. | 899.24
If you are able to do better, you will be able to give R-to-Sell certificate, the | 902.279
things will be yours and also tell that | 904.759
India is the only country in the world | 907.199
which will meet its targets on time | 910.6
and also | 914.6
we have reduced carbon emissions more than our liabilities. | 917.0
This is the message that should be sent from the Parliament to the world. | 919.519
Question No. | 922.079
42 Suresh | 929.959
Ri K Suresh ji Honorable Minister | 935.759
K Suresh Malata This question | 940.16
was related to Climate Change | 943.12
which Minister | 948.44
ji Kasar has been placed on the table of the | 952.68
House Amra Ram | 954.38
[Music] | 957.04
ji your  Through this medium, I would like to know from the Minister | 960.079
that lakhs of our | 962.959
Indians go there for employment and business in the Gulf countries, | 965.639
where the departure has been done at 2 | 972.0
in three months and in the Gulf, there have been 2 or | 976.399
60 flights in three months, then how much | 980.12
time?  First, you have informed the airlines that | 984.639
how many passengers have been affected by this | 987.6
and how many have suffered losses. | 991.279
Minister, tell me when the condition of one Indian Airlines | 994.16
is then how many of the airlines, | 997.68
Honorable Minister, have been affected and how many people have been | 999.92
affected.  Once the Honorable Members would have | 1003.36
asked, Honorable Minister Sir, | 1005.44
this question was asked according to Air India, | 1008.68
so we had given the information about it, | 1010.8
Sir, when it comes to cancellations and delays, | 1013.839
between April and June. | 1016.92
June Office Year Overall Sir, | 1021.12
because this topic was related to Kerala, the | 1023.68
information about it has been kept now, if it is about the | 1026.16
rest of the country, then you will definitely | 1029.16
tell you later about that also and | 1031.64
will take the circular, but according to this, Sir, the total number of cancellations in April will be | 1037.6
14.  Sir, there have been 132 cancellations in April | 1041.52
and 18 in June, a total of | 1044.76
164 cancellations in the three months. Casey Wayne | 1047.72
Gopal, | 1051.799
The delay of the | 1054.32
flight especially in India and other incidents has become | 1058.28
the fear of the day of | 1059.799
not being a member of Parliament, | 1063.88
Kerala.  Many people are living in Middle | 1067.16
East suffering from delay | 1071.6
sometime the flight has been canceled without | 1076.039
any information there | 1077.44
no cancellation | 1080.559
charges not given to the customer no cancellation is a common thing by the | 1087.12
government studies thing and | 1091.559
government firm to set up system to monitor | 1095.72
This Cancellation And What Action Government Is | 1098.88
Going To Take One More Thing For | 1106.559
Kerala Government Them Self Already Given | 1110.84
Memorandum Yourself Enter MP Given | 1113.44
Memorandum So Many Times That The Hike Fare | 1117.159
Of The Girl Child Sector The Fare Is Very Ex | 1121.799
Bitly High There Is No | 1125.4
Justification Over  Same | 1132.52
padar ok | 1134.6
ok sir Air India the rebel member who has | 1139.039
raised the senior member who has raised regarding | 1140.6
the cancellations and we acknowledge | 1143.36
the fact that there has been one issue with the | 1145.44
Air India Express not Air India sir | 1147.12
Air India Express specially in the month  Of | 1149.52
June on May 7th of this year Sir there are a lot | 1152.96
of the crew with Air India Express because it was | 1156.84
merging with Air Asia there were some | 1159.48
internal issues that have cropped up and there was a | 1161.76
mass strike that has happened because | 1163.96
of the strike which is  Why there were a lot | 1166.08
of cancellations that have happened also | 1168.08
and this we have seen in the month of May | 1170.24
and in fact the yearling that I have given the | 1172.679
number of cancellations there was a huge | 1174.4
spike in May because of this issue and once | 1177.08
this issue started it  Was a ministry which got | 1179.76
evolved The DGCA a | 1182.24
facilitated a lot of discussions between the | 1184.88
airlines the crew members and everything it was | 1186.96
sorted sir but because of the gap which | 1190.36
a for the three days when the | 1193.2
cancellations when the crew was not | 1194.919
functioning there was  Another software glitch also which happened because | 1197.12
of this | 1198.84
software glitch the crew member data which was supposed to be | 1201.559
with the airlines there was some | 1203.48
problem with that and then manually they | 1205.24
tried to enter and so for everything to | 1207.72
get back to normal see there was some  Time But | 1210.2
Right Now We Are Assuring That There Are No | 1212.039
Cancellations Or No Delays Happening In The | 1213.919
Flight System And Like You Have Mentioned Sir There Are | 1216.4
Civil Aviation Requirements | 1218.36
Also There Are Already Regulations And | 1220.2
Guidelines Which Are In Place Which Will | 1222.159
Ensure That When Ever There Is  A delay | 1223.88
happening and a cancellation happening and if the | 1226.28
airline is not following the regulations that are | 1228.919
being set up by the ministry then the | 1230.96
ministry gets evolved and it is | 1237.799
uncertainty and I would like to take an | 1239.919
example also recently when Air India | 1242.36
was not the one observed we  Investigated | 1244.64
And We Observe That Air India Was Not | 1246.24
Following A Certain Guideline We Have Penalized | 1249.36
Them For ₹ Lakh And This Air India | 1251.6
Express Incident Also This Strike | 1253.24
Incident Which Has Happened We Are DGCA | 1255.64
Is Going In To Depth It Is | 1257.08
Investigating The Issue If It Seems To  If there is any | 1260.24
non compliance from the airlines then | 1263.159
definitely we are going to penalize them and | 1264.919
ensure that the passenger is the top | 1267.559
priority Mr. Praveen | 1271.76
Patel Praveen | 1275.76
Patel I would like to express my gratitude to you for giving us the opportunity to ask questions. | 1281.72
My question is to the Honorable Minister. | 1284.96
Prayagraj Airport is related to last | 1288.6
Kumbh, about 22 crore people came to Kumbh | 1292.2
and a record number of | 1294.96
people came through the airport, so we | 1297.679
want to know this from the Honorable Minister | 1300.52
because the upcoming Kumbh is going to happen and this | 1303.2
time the proposed  Around 40 crore people are | 1306.48
likely to come. There will be a lot of pressure on the airport, | 1310.279
so will the facility of night landing be | 1313.08
provided there and can | 1316.72
it be given the facility of an international airport during the Kumbh? | 1322.12
Question to you: Rebel Speaker Sir, the question is not | 1325.2
directly related to  The question is on | 1327.88
the list today so I will give the member the | 1331.48
relevant information after | 1336.799
word 43 Question No. 43 Now once again | 1342.24
you all are new but study all the departments in three months. | 1346.679
Next time | 1349.88
answer completely | 1351.679
perfectly. This is the session of Parliament.  Sir, there is a | 1355.24
question list of one airport and | 1357.279
from 157 airports, Sir, | 1360.44
because of Prime Minister Modi, the 74 airports have now | 1363.6
become 157. Sir, in the last 10 years, now we have to | 1366.36
do 157 for preparation, | 1368.76
Sir.  Quay No. | 1371.72
43 Balasori Sir Question No. 43 | 1380.6
becomes play on the table of the | 1384.96
House Honorable Member Sir First I | 1389.84

KKs works started | 1415.88
2019 and they are supposed to be completed by | 1420.4
2022 but till today there is no major | 1424.96
progress as yet  This is the reason behind the | 1428.32
delay and since Narbal Minister from my | 1431.76
state understands the importance of this | 1434.76
airport it is our capital city airport | 1438.08
i Amravati f is the new capital of AP ok | 1441.48
manam their supplement this airport is | 1444.48
important for us sir my question is | 1448.279
what  Is the new deadline for completion of | 1451.039
this project and how does this minister make sure that | 1453.6
this time all the proposed works | 1457.64
will be completed before the set | 1460.64
deadline Speaker Sir I totally agree with what the | 1463.88
rebel member of Parliament is saying that | 1466.399
this was a | 1469.32
work  Which was started in March 2020 | 1472.279
June 2020 Sir and the overall estimator cost | 1475.52
of the project was 611 crores and there has been subsequent delay Which was continued because | 1481.64
of the Covid that has happened and also because | 1483.96
like the member has mentioned I also came | 1486.12
from the state  Sir it is the capital | 1488.279
airport that we have but for the last few | 1490.88
years there have been other external | 1492.679
factors also in the state which has hindered | 1494.44
the progress of this especially due to the | 1497.12
availability of sand and other | 1499.559
materials in the state sir but right now we | 1501.799
R Insurance is going to be completed | 1503.799
on time I have taken it up as a top | 1505.96
priority and the new deadline that we have | 1508.0
fixed is June 2025 Sir for this | 1511.24
project supplementary poochna hai yes sir ji | 1515.559
in short sir at the outset let me also | 1519.44
thank Narbal  Minister S soon as he took the | 1521.72
charge he introduced two flights from | 1524.36
Vijayawada to Mumbai otherwise there was no | 1527.2
flight to Mumbai this was a long | 1528.919
pending demand from all over Delhi | 1533.84
and we are requesting we need | 1537.799
flight from Vijayawada to Kolkata | 1540.039
Vijayawada to Warsi and additional flight  To | 1543.32
Delhi to Visakha Patnam and Tirupati also | 1546.039

Honorable Minister sir this is a very good sign | 1562.279
For this country, the aspiration of the people of the country | 1566.32
and through the people of the honorable members has started | 1568.72
rising that an | 1571.0
airport will be built in my place too, this is a good sign | 1573.52
for the country. Sir, very much sir and like I just | 1577.64
mention the infrastructure around | 1579.679
airports is  Increase so much and in the last | 1581.72
10 years a huge push has been given for | 1583.919
Civil Aviation Ministry and right now the | 1586.399
members are raising them | 1589.48
and asking for new airport | 1591.12
connectivity it was almost if you go back | 1593.36
10 years and 20 years back it used to.  Be the | 1595.6
demand with Railways Sir, then we used to ask Railways whether we | 1597.919
need trains or stops, now that | 1600.44
situation has come to Airways Sir, Airways is the | 1602.679
new railway of the country and I am very proud about | 1604.36

speaking about the same, sir, but the | 1616.12
humble mention about the connect, but let me make | 1619.2
it clear from the ministry, sir, we don't have | 1621.0
any direct jurisdiction, we were | 1624.159
interfering with the connectivity.  Of | 1627.52
the airlines it is entirely a demand driven | 1629.799
process market driven process and the | 1631.88
airlines decide what connectivity we offer the | 1634.48
infrastructure if the airlines say | 1636.799
I want to run this from here to there | 1638.72
then we ensure that there is airport | 1640.36
connectivity on both the places but  What we | 1643.44
do sir because there has been a big demand | 1645.64
from all the members that we need to connect here and | 1649.159

in short thank you for giving us this opportunity | 1884.279
through you.  I want to ask the Honorable Minister | 1888.799
about the Puri International Airport. There was a need for this airport in 2021 | 1893.0
for the International | 1896.36
Airport in Puri and in the year 2023 the | 1899.799
grant for the site clearance was forwarded | 1902.12
by the Ministry of Civil  Aviation I just want to know what | 1904.679
is the progress in this | 1906.679
field because the airport is to be built in | 1909.96
Brahmagiri tehsil very close to the | 1912.0
Jagannath Temple and because of the reverence of | 1915.12
Jagannath Temple and Puri being a tourist | 1917.44
destination this airport is of prime | 1920.32
importance.  So I would like to know through the | 1922.919
rebel speaker as to how we have progress | 1926.24
thank | 1927.039
you Sir | 1933.679
Puri Sir Puri Puri | 1938.08
Puri which is the field airport of Lord Jagannath Ji, | 1941.519
regarding that Sir this | 1945.24
airport is a green feed airport sir and | 1948.0
field airport  When it is built, first of all | 1949.72
the state writes to us that we are selling this land here so that | 1952.84
a new | 1955.08
airport can be built here and in the same way, when we got the proposal | 1957.799
to the ministry that the state | 1960.08
wants to build an airport there, then | 1962.24
we gave its insight clearance.  Sir, the | 1964.48
general procedure has been given, this is after insight, | 1967.0
after side clearance in principle, | 1968.96
that state should again | 1971.919
make DPR and after reviewing all the land, power and | 1976.08
water, it will | 1979.08
come back to us in principle. | 1981.48
Writes to sir for approval but till now we have not | 1983.639
received anything from the state for these principal approvals | 1986.679
sir but the | 1991.399
responsibility lies with the | 1994.2
state government to construct the airport because it is a green field airport being made on PPP mode. | 1995.96
We give side clearance sir, it has been given | 1997.88
and if the state writes to us that pre-in | 2001.12
principle approval is required then we will definitely take | 2003.399
action against it and give it sir, it has | 2005.519

being done on this side but I don't have | 2332.4
the information to the  Noble Member C Dayanidhi | 2335.76
Maran | 2338.72
Sir Tired Speaker Sir Sir, we give you a chance, | 2344.48
we give you a chance, but sitting and | 2350.599
talking sir, | 2352.76
[ __ ] diem minister, you are the best party, welcome | 2358.28
father, good fandom | 2360.8
sir, at the same time, booking tickets for Delhi online | 2366.359
bookings to Tata.  And the software is | 2369.44
developed by Tata TCS so this is seen every | 2373.24
time a scene one I book a ticket it around Rs | 2376.16
33000 sir one way ticket from Chennai to | 2378.839
Delhi when I go to make the payment the error | 2381.52
message comes the moment the error message comes the | 2384.64
Price goes to 93000 and | 2387.56
78000 yes sir this judge has been happening because probably | 2390.64
TCS is using this super money | 2394.48
in their software and because we have a so | 2397.56
everyone judge got a miles account so we are | 2400.04
locked in so this is happening very | 2402.16
frequency | 2407.24
rules because DGCA  Is only in charge | 2410.24
when the airline cancels the flight or | 2412.8
reschedules but this is happening in software | 2415.64
ft sir there is a conspiracy happening and we | 2419.16
would like you to do an | 2421.359
inquiry because this is now the monopoly in | 2424.359
the business segment where money is paid  By the | 2426.56
Government of India Ticket Hon'ble Minister, the | 2428.56
honorable member has raised a very serious issue | 2430.92
and it is very serious, it should be investigated, | 2434.92
many honorable members complained about this | 2437.44
because its money goes from the Parliament, | 2439.68
so I am worried, definitely sir, we | 2443.56
will get the  Matter Investigated And Also | 2447.079
Like Our Senior Member Has Mentioned DGCI | 2450.56
Looks After The Rights Of The Passengers And | 2452.88
It Dives Into That And Also There Is | 2455.319
DGCA Traffic Monitoring Tariff | 2457.8
Monitoring Unit Also Looks After This | 2460.28
Specific Issue That You Said So We Are Going | 2462.359
To Investigate  That we are going to answer that this kind of | 2464.52
incident may not happen in the | 2466.4
future sir thank you Question No. | 2469.48
45 Smt. Kamalji | 2473.64
Sarawat Honorable Minister | 2482.48
Mr. Speaker Sir, the | 2491.8
details of the answers to question no. 45 from A to D have been laid on the table of the House, | 2495.8
Honorable | 2499.8
Member.  Thank you Respected Speaker Sir Sir, | 2504.319
I have read the answers given on the table | 2507.16
carefully. First of all, I | 2509.359
want to thank you. The Ministry had a | 2511.8
very important role in MSME in | 2515.92
providing employment to the women and youth of the country | 2517.92
and on this table.  The answer that has been replied was that the | 2521.24
number till 2021 was 488 Haj | 2526.56
but the scheme brought by the Ministry named Udyam | 2529.8
on July 1, 2020 was very | 2534.359
good, it was paperless, it was online, it | 2537.0
was on self-declaration and because of that, | 2540.04
I got this answer.  The number | 2543.16
of women in it has increased from 4,88,000 to one crore | 2548.48
lakh. Sir, first of all I | 2551.2
want to thank the Ministry that to further | 2554.48
support the religion, it has brought the Enterprise Assistant | 2557.0
platform on 11 January 2023 | 2560.8
so that women  It is | 2563.559
especially convenient to register here. Sir, my | 2566.16
question is to Sir, can you tell me what is the | 2573.44
sector wise breakdown of the women who are working in MS here? | 2578.599
Honorable Minister, | 2584.48
Chairman, it is clear.  That the Government of India, which is | 2589.079
running under the leadership of Honorable Narendra Modi ji, is paying | 2600.8
special attention to the women belonging to the critical section, that is to say, the people belonging to the critical section, Scheduled Caste, etc. In the same question, | 2607.359
we question the question that has been asked in relation to women.  We are | 2610.44
very thankful to the honorable women that today under this pretext | 2614.119
we can tell the honorable parliament | 2620.119
what is being done by our department, especially MSME, for the upliftment of women, | 2622.92
which we have discussed till now.  If you are | 2629.04
asking about what is the different fraction of these, | 2632.16
then we have given in it that there are | 2636.599
two types of sections in it, one is | 2639.839
enterprise and the other is which is other than enterprise, in | 2643.64
which in general, whoever has  She ca | 2648.52
n't fulfill that condition also, so | 2651.839
for that sir see, micro in enterprise is | 2655.64
different for small and medium, then | 2658.559
in micro they have | 2663.839
given 2621 and in the same way in UAP they have | 2668.079
given 7011 and in the same way in UAP | 2671.96
also.  19900 has been given, that is to say, it has been done differently | 2675.8
in both and as | 2678.52
far as women are concerned, | 2682.72
their development in enterprise is 21.35% and in UAP | 2689.04
their development is 6.11%, so in this way it can be said | 2692.599
that we women are | 2695.88
We do the work of taking it forward and the rest of the | 2699.44
honorable MPs have asked for special information, | 2703.88
so we will get it sent to them. Honorable Member, | 2708.96
thank you, Minister, without women, the | 2712.319
country cannot progress. Half the population is | 2714.68
so important. This is what the Prime Minister does in | 2717.28
every work.  And | 2719.92
this number is big, so I thank him and the | 2722.68
Minister a lot, but I have | 2724.68
a question sir, all the friends | 2727.76
sitting here have both urban and rural | 2730.64
sectors, if we know this number.  Let's see how many | 2733.28
numbers have been registered in Urban and Ruler, | 2736.079
so that all the | 2738.48
friends sitting here find it easier to work in their respective fields, | 2740.28
then my | 2743.319
question to the Minister is how many women are registered in Ruler and Urban part in MSME and | 2748.599
in what percentage.  If you tell us whether women are registered, then | 2751.04
it will be easier for us to encourage them to work further. | 2755.8
Thank you | 2758.88
Speaker Sir, I have told them | 2762.24
that there is a report of the total MSMEs registered and those who have applied. | 2766.119
Under that, | 2771.92
we will include 247 of them from 2024 onwards.  Implemented and | 2774.2
even this has been done, I have the numbers in it | 2777.72
and will send them but | 2779.88
as far as the percentage is concerned, I | 2782.559
said that the total percentage is | 2785.92
38.8 and zero for all but as far as women are | 2791.76
concerned, there are two parts in women.  One is for the | 2795.48
enterprises, so there is 21.3% of the enterprises and one | 2800.079
is for the UAPs who are not qualified in the enterprises, | 2804.24
who need water or when it comes to GST, there are | 2808.079
very small people | 2810.28
like tailors who do any | 2813.16
small work.  They do not have this, | 2815.0
for their convenience also we get them registered for this | 2817.559
and their number is | 2821.88
3.80, which is a hole, 63 is 111, | 2828.88
so this shows how sensitive we are towards women. | 2831.44
Sir, it is very  Well | 2834.88
Mrs. Ajita | 2840.319
Sarangi House of Indian Economy reported that they | 2844.559

question that has been asked, so | 2897.72

number of MA to ME owned by women is concerned, in India as a whole, it is 1 | 2909.04
crore 84 lakh 57000 something. | 2914.24
In Himachal Pradesh, it is | 2918.04
8334. As far as Orissa is concerned, it is | 2923.72
6559 and the question was also | 2928.16

I have the one for Mayurbhanj too, which has been told | 2933.599

that out of the same number of people who buy them, | 3046.319
3 per cent of them | 3049.839
must buy the products made by women.  A huge | 3052.76
facility has been given and | 3057.16
our women have done the work of Rs. 300 crore in this | 3060.64
and the 19000 women who are engaged in it and | 3064.92

from 172020 itself, looking at this thing which | 3074.599
we can see right now  Granted, this is quite sufficient, | 3077.68

Honorable Speaker | 3228.92
Sir When the scheme of GeM was started by Respected | 3232.119
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Saheb, at | 3233.839
that time there were connections in Andhra | 3237.92
and in the last  In the past few years, about | 3242.44
40% or 72% of this work has been done in Andhra Pradesh. | 3248.52
In the coming days, depending on the | 3255.96
funds | 3259.16
and technical assistance received from the Government of Andhra Pradesh and the Central Government, it will reach | 3261.96
100%.  Honorable members are moving forward to work on this. | 3271.76
Speaker Aalok T Ask Hanal Minister What is the | 3276.28
major challenge faced by the Government on not | 3279.04
getting 100 functional household tap | 3282.079
connections in Andhra Pradesh and Jal Mission what is the main challenge? | 3286.599
Being taken to overcome challenges | 3290.079
especially in remote districts. Thanks to this, | 3303.04
100% work has been done in about 11 districts and eight UT states across the country. In the coming few | 3306.559
days, many more states are moving towards 100%. | 3310.559
Andhra is also at 73.  It is going on with the water and the | 3315.68
rest of their watering process has also been done | 3318.119
and their work is going on. I hope | 3321.72
that very soon it will be added to the club in 100% form. The | 3325.4
work of water will also be done and | 3328.4
water will be available to everyone from village to village.  Will go Mr. | 3331.24
Tariq | 3335.359
Anwar Well, basically this question is | 3338.24
related to Andhra but Judge Jeevan | 3341.599
Mission is a national program. I | 3347.2
want to draw the attention of the Minister towards Bihar and want to know | 3351.16
from the Minister that groundwater in Bihar.  In view of the | 3353.839
large scale spread of cancer in Bihar due to excess of dirty ash, how is | 3364.799
this Jal Jeevan Mission being | 3368.44
taken forward in Bihar and how | 3371.4
efforts are being made to run it effectively in | 3374.64
Bihar.  Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, | 3383.68
how many houses with non-connection and tap connections have got water till now and | 3387.359
especially in my area Seemanchal which is | 3390.799
a very backward area of ​​Bihar and in that | 3394.52
also our area Katiyar is where we | 3399.88
During my speech, we see that this | 3404.16
program is not running very effectively, | 3407.16
so I would like to draw the | 3411.559
attention of the government to run this program strongly in Bihar. | 3418.4
Honorable Speaker, | 3421.359
Bihar is a state which has started this | 3425.68
JJM.  He has not asked for any money from the Central Government for this | 3428.16
and in his own name, in his | 3432.92
own way, the work of tap water supply has been | 3437.359
done there. | 3441.599
He said that the reason for this is that some different types | 3444.52
of liquids come in the water.  Whatever | 3446.16
problem is there, we will definitely | 3450.079
keep it in mind of the government there that work should be done on it | 3452.319
and | 3455.119
now as per the report sent by the state, | 3458.0
almost 100% of | 3461.24
this work has been done by the state government in Bihar.  I have | 3464.16
done it on my own strength, | 3468.2
Shri | 3470.24
Krishna, thank you sir, there is a good progress | 3473.68
that has been made with respect to Jal Jeevan | 3475.799
Mission, last year sir, from 3 to almost | 3478.88
11, new connections have been added in the country and also | 3481.24
in Andhra.  Rs 30 lakh to | 3484.359
another Rs 39 lakh has been added in Andhra Pradesh | 3486.4
but the problem is coming Rs | 3490.599
350 crore has been given under the water | 3494.92
mission but the problem is I have ever | 3498.64
given connection from the overhead tank to  The | 3500.52
every household sir but I am coming from a | 3503.96
location from constancy where if you dig a | 3506.64
borewell of 1200 feet also there is no water | 3509.52
that is coming up sir so you have a connection | 3511.52
from the tank to the household but there is no | 3513.52
water in  The tank sir so the funds that you have been | 3516.48
allocated the funds that have been spent are | 3518.799
not being used properly sir so if you can | 3521.92
guide us in true way that the source can be found where | 3524.599
water is actually can be | 3526.92
given to the overhead  Tank if then it will be | 3529.92
of any use sir unless you do that there | 3533.319
is a huge wastage of funds that has been | 3535.4
happening so if you can guide us how it can be | 3537.2
addressed it will be of great help as | 3538.92
thank you very | 3541.28
much Honorable Chairman | 3544.48
Yes, the question of the honorable member is very serious | 3548.0
and complaints also come from many places, | 3550.599
it is the job of the state government, it is their | 3554.4
responsibility to find the source of it, that is also | 3558.0
their job, but at many places, what the | 3561.72
state governments have done is to bore the brunt. | 3563.68
Water was not found in it or it was found less, | 3566.96
because of that the water there gets reduced or ends even in March to April, because of that there is | 3571.92
tap water, there is no water, | 3574.92
we have made different arrangements with different state governments. | 3578.48
During the meeting, I brought to their attention the | 3580.72
new technical system that has come up, | 3587.72
we can know where the water is, how much is it in quantity, on the basis of that, if a | 3591.599
bore is made there, then on the basis of that, if the bore is made, | 3594.72
water will also be available.  If the village is big, then | 3597.839
more than one bore should be done. | 3600.68
We have also given them a suggestion there because even if they do | 3603.68
two bores or three bores at the expense of the Ministry, | 3606.48
they still get money, but the quantity of water is | 3609.4
fixed for them as per the | 3611.44
expectation of the village.  There is a plan to provide 55 liters of pure water in every village, | 3614.72
so if that | 3617.88
quantity of water is available, if the | 3620.88
planning is done in that way, then whatever | 3623.92
problem the member is facing now, the problem will be solved | 3626.76
and on top of that, we will move ahead. | 3630.24
Question Hour is | 3632.119
increasing Honorable members, I have | 3637.119
received notices of adjournment motion from many recognized members. | 3640.28
I have not given permission for any notice of adjournment motion. | 3646.4
Papers to be laid on the Table of the House Item Number Two |
