Dos Evolving Repeat of Routine Task My | 88.96
question is through you Sir Bir Nala Minister | 92.88
Hon'ble Minister t Weather the | 99.56
Central Government having a plan to | 103.56
address the problem which I am going to face annually | 107.119
69 million people will be displaced and what is | 111.6
the planning  Of the Central Government to | 115.0
address the question it adds to the question in addition to that I have | 120.039
a request to you sir this switch | 122.68
burning issue please kindly | 128.319
allow a discussion under rule 55 of | 132.4
this | 137.16
issue Honorable Speaker Sir the question raised by the honorable member is  It | 145.28
is based on a prediction when in 2016 a World Bank | 150.28
team said that in | 156.879
10 years, through automation, | 159.0
69 jobs will be lost in India, 77 in China, | 165.319
85 in Egypt and 85 in Ethiopia. | 169.239
Honorable Speaker Sir Y | 174.44
Estimate World  The bank estimated the reality | 178.239
and projections after 10 years and when the | 181.76
internet came in the country, there was talk that there | 185.0
would be jobs in the country and there would be jobs in the world. When the | 187.0
internet came, even the jobs did not go. Many jobs were created from | 189.72
time to time, some on the basis of some estimate.  By doing this, | 193.319
its effect will reach here and | 196.159
in the country, when the | 198.12
mobile came in the country, then there was talk, when the computer | 202.92
came, there was talk that people will lose their jobs in the country, there | 206.64
will be less jobs. I, | 210.04
Honorable Speaker Sir, want to tell you | 212.28
whether the mobile came and the mobile.  If there is a | 214.36
conversation through mail, if the | 217.04
traffic in railways has ever reduced, if | 220.56
communication has increased so much, then if there has been any reduction in crowd in air travel or | 223.68
at the airport, is this an | 227.4
estimate? And when I was seeing Covid, I | 229.519
was in health at that time.  I | 232.36
was talking to the world and when Covid was going on in the world, the | 234.159
world used to estimate that the | 238.72
world's count would be based on the number of deaths in India. | 241.519
I, Speaker Sir, want to tell you that I am | 244.159
happy about the post on Covid. | 247.799
India has the lowest number of deaths per million population, | 250.439
this is true, that's why | 254.72
I answer you, Kalyan ji, that's why it is an | 256.68
estimate, there is | 260.04
no need to worry, the truth is | 263.4
visible in front of you that the Indian economy will | 266.08
grow at 6 to 7.  When a country's | 270.24
economy grows at 7 to 8, it | 273.88
naturally grows when | 275.72
manufacturing increases, | 278.36
service sector increases, when purchasing power | 280.96
increases, if all this happens then the | 284.24
opportunity for automatic employment also increases, there is no need to worry.  There | 287.28
is no need to go to the National Service | 290.96
Center Porter even today there are 19 lakh jobs, even today 30 | 297.08
lakh job providers have kept the companies saying | 301.44
let's apply here or I am talking about the portal, | 304.52
you can see it by going out from here and | 306.759
seeing it immediately.  If someone in your family also | 310.16
needs a job and if he has the qualification as per his requirement, | 313.32
then he will also | 316.12
get the job. There is no dearth of jobs in the country. | 318.919
Honorable | 321.88
member, this is not the answer. This is given anyway. We have to | 325.479
understand these things. Sir, this is the answer.  Aya | 330.759
Se Yud Se The Answer Anyway Second | 334.0
Supplementary Sar It is Nice to See From the | 338.52
Reports of | 340.919
the Central | 343.56
Government The State Wise Estimator | 347.12
Rate during 2022 & 23 So Far West | 350.72
Bengal I Concern Only | 353.639
2.2 Only 2.2 Russia Kerala True Literate State | 360.4
7 | 361.4
per Rajasthan and 4 | 364.72
per sir my question is in the answer it has become given | 371.52
in various ministry department | 373.96
government of India like micro small | 375.759
minimum ministry so so different scheme you have said about | 378.88
this I don't want to repeat what | 381.56
element | 384.039
employment there should be  Relationship of Apple | 387.36
and Air | 390.16
It Consists of | 392.319
Post Because of Introduction of Sun | 396.639
Scheme | 398.4
Some Job Can Be Cut But Not Create a Relation | 405.24
Element Complete Different Thing | 407.599
as Air Budge Never Country | 411.44
The Employment Concept or Central | 415.879
Government | 417.0
Government Private Sector Laws are Made | 420.599
Applicable Before Termination Like  In the | 423.56
Central Government the lr private | 426.56
sector Industrial Dispute Act is made | 429.16
applicable so labor should not be implemented because | 434.28
of hire and fire policy of any | 437.28
employer now wether the central government is | 441.0
having the scheme today in private sector | 444.039
you don't have any control over hire and  Fire | 446.68
policy can be applied and so many works are being | 449.84
thrown out now the question is how it | 452.84
will save how it will give the security of | 456.599
employment in the minds of the workers who are | 460.84
working in a private establishment and | 463.479
whether we will seriously think to bring  A | 466.44
legislation to control this private sector so that | 470.12
hire and fire policy is not made | 472.639
applicable and the workers are not thrown into | 476.479
employment Honorable Minister Mr. Speaker | 480.36
Sir in a job the employer never | 485.12
wants to fire his employee | 489.599
but for that | 492.039
there is either | 494.28
him or her  So either he | 498.56
gets a job at another place or he | 501.4
gets an opportunity at a better place, either in a | 503.759
C-class factory or his unit is closed, | 506.24
then in such a situation the worker has to | 508.44
go to another place. My question is, have | 511.36
you heard about it?  The one who quoted that the employment rate in West Bengal is | 521.0
7% of the country's population | 524.279
and FDI is coming to Bengal is 075%, there is a | 529.56
need to increase it. Bengal is a | 533.48
part of the country, I have no other option for that.  Do | 535.519
not comment, there is a need to increase it. | 537.959
When the industry service sector increases in a state, | 540.399
employment is created. | 543.64
You have to protest in front of the industry | 546.72
and if the industry is closed, Apple is free, | 549.24
so it says that guarantee its employment.  It is | 550.959
not possible. Secondly, | 555.56
I would like to do it. I would like to do it. | 561.519
First of all, the situation in the country before 201 was like this. In the | 565.2
world, only data was talked about. Here | 568.24
in India, there was | 570.959
no such thing as generating data and making a robbing system for it. | 573.92
Ever since the Modi Government has been in power, | 577.519
they have made preparations and the | 580.56
system of data generation may be within the country or outside, | 583.839
but the data should be created and generated in the country | 586.399
and this data is the | 589.8
labor force participation data from our place in the world today. | 593.12
He | 596.0
is appreciated in the world, this data started in 2017, | 599.839
I want to tell you from this data, | 602.16
Honorable Minister, it will | 605.04
not take 20 minutes for one question, I will not do it, but | 607.519
I should reply well. | 609.519
Speaker Sir, give me an opportunity, I can do this through this medium. | 614.079
I want to tell the country from the authentic data, the | 621.6
data given by the agency of the Government of India, when the LFPR survey started from our place | 625.8
in 20171, then the overall | 631.56
labor participation rate in the country was 38, | 637.399
which is today at 44.  The work population | 642.399
ratio | 644.04
was 31 in 201718, today it has increased to 40 | 649.88
and the employment rate, you yourself have said, should be | 653.079
below 3. If I was studying in the question today, that | 655.079
too should be less today than | 660.36
what | 664.0
came in 20171. Understanding very well, you too. | 666.959
I understand the question, I understand Bengal | 669.36
too, I understand the country too. The | 671.68
unemployment rate was at 6. Speaker Sir, | 677.72
employment generation took place in the Modi government. | 681.32
Many types of schemes were launched. People | 685.0
got employment opportunities and | 687.959
today the unemployment rate is 3.  % and in future it should go less than 3. | 692.959
VD | 695.6
Sharma, let me tell you one thing, I sit BD | 699.36
ji, the honorable member is also requested to sit and | 702.44
said while sitting and the honorable minister | 706.88
starts answering whatever the member says while sitting, why do you answer?  Yes, why do you | 710.079
respond to what they are saying while sitting, don't | 712.6
even take notice of them, you should | 715.279
talk towards the speaker and should speak in 'S'. | 719.72
Honorable Honorable Speaker Sir, I want to | 723.079
ask the Honorable Minister through you | 724.839
that the government has made plans for the employment of youth. | 727.839
What steps have been taken in this regard, as well as | 736.8
what is the government's plan regarding the gap between demand and supply of record skills in the industries? | 740.12
Speaker Sir, this budget is a youth | 745.72
centric budget, it is an employment centric budget.  A | 757.16
provision of Rs 2 lakh crore has been made for employment generation of 4 lakh youth in 5 years. It will be very useful | 760.12
for employment generation for the youth of the country in the coming days | 763.32
and even today | 766.959
Stand Up India Startup is providing job opportunities to the youth of the country. | 773.6
Under India Make in India, they are helped to encourage many types of self-employment and | 777.48
self-enterprise. | 782.76
Question No. | 785.56
82: Honorable, please, you new members do | 789.72
not come unless you are called, do | 792.76
not get up after giving hands in the House, | 795.199
okay.  Is | 797.44
n't it que number 8, you are a senior person, you should | 800.56
not get up at all, que number 8 | 802.56
will come next, Chand Prakash Joshi, que number | 808.12
8, Honorable Speaker, Sir, the answer was laid on the table, Honorable | 812.639
Speaker, Sir, I, | 815.6
through you, request the Honorable Minister on an important issue. | 818.44
I want to do about pollution. | 823.76
Many innovations have taken place in the last 10 years under the leadership of the Honorable Prime Minister. There have been | 828.92
many innovations to eliminate dirt and control pollution in cities and villages, | 830.6
but it is still seen | 833.36
that in cities and villages,  There are many | 835.279
industries in the world which cause land | 837.88
pollution, air pollution, water | 839.88
pollution, etc. and these types of acids are | 842.839
released into water and rivers. Animals | 845.32
die there. If people cannot drink water, then | 848.839
this type of pollution needs to be controlled.  For this, the | 854.16
government often makes the surrounding fields barren, | 857.16
so in such a situation, is there | 863.079
any mechanism made to | 868.04
help such entrepreneurs in their identification, whether it is drinking water or compensation for farming? | 871.279
Honorable Chairman, National Clean  Under the Air | 876.519
Mission Programme, Rs. 11210 crores have been sanctioned by the 15th Finance Commission in the last 10 years. | 884.839
As the honorable | 887.639
member has raised the question, this program is for | 891.0
air quality, water | 895.639
quality and solid waste management as | 899.12
well as dust management.  Money is | 901.04
made available. As far as the | 903.88
issue of water pollution is concerned, the honorable member has | 906.759
raised this right issue. We have | 910.32
selected 131 cities on the basis | 913.279
that their air quality standards have not been touched in the last five years.  In | 920.72
which all the subjects are included, there is also water and | 925.04
air, there is also solid waste management, | 927.88
funds are provided for it. | 930.88
I have also attached the list of 131 cities with it | 934.399
and in that we are | 937.6
continuously doing work to improve the water quality. | 939.72
Which is monitored by CPCB | 941.68
and whose updates are also kept on Prana portal. | 943.959
Honorable Member Supplementary, | 947.759
Honorable Minister has given a very detailed | 950.44
reply in writing and still your | 952.24
reply has come. It is planted many times for pollution control.  Even if it is | 956.88
mentioned in a large number of CSR papers, is there | 962.839
any mechanism made to audit it so that | 965.36
whatever type of pollution it is, | 967.399
it can be controlled and the plantations will | 969.399
definitely be taken up?  If we | 973.16
will play an important role in controlling pollution in that area, then has | 975.199
any such mechanism been made that how many | 977.399
plants have been planted, how many have been planted and how many have been taken up, | 982.079
I would like to know about this from the Honorable Minister, many | 984.399
thanks to the Honorable Speaker Sir, who is the Honorable | 987.44
Member.  Has asked a question and | 989.92
this is the subject of monitoring of National Clean Air, but the | 992.759
one supporting question he has | 995.199
raised is about plants. However, | 997.759
this work is done by the Green India Mission in the Government of India. | 1000.24
Honorable Speaker Sir, | 1003.519
since I, the Honorable  The member asked a question | 1005.68
and I | 1008.36
also want to bring an important issue to the notice of the House through you that | 1012.0
on this Environment Day on 5th, | 1014.88
a big | 1016.44
initiative 'Ek Pedre Maa' has been implemented by the Honorable Prime Minister | 1019.48
and through you  I have | 1022.759
also written letters to all the MP members. We have | 1028.4
made the local DFO its nodal officer because this earth is like our mother, the | 1031.079
mother gives birth to us and the | 1033.48
earth gives us everything from food to energy to | 1036.52
medicine.  I | 1039.24
would also like to appeal through you that there is a | 1041.48
mission in the name of mother, that is | 1043.679
a big program for tree plantation and | 1046.199
through you, this House should also cooperate in it. [ | 1049.76
Music] | 1052.08
No, it is a good effort that all the | 1054.2
honorable members.  Shri Rodmal Nagar should be concerned about the environment and | 1056.96
get success in the campaign of planting trees. | 1061.36
Thank you, | 1064.44
Sir, what steps has the government taken to control the pollution caused by waste semiconductor, lead etc. | 1076.84
Honorable Speaker, Sir, the question asked by the honorable member. | 1081.679
He has said that | 1091.919
what steps has been taken by the government to remove the lead etc. which gets mixed in the air or is present in the pollution. I | 1094.52
want to say through you that when we | 1098.159
check the air quality of any city, it is not just the lead. | 1100.76
So we see | 1103.2
how much carbon monoxide is there, how much trounce oxide is there, | 1106.48
how much sulph oxide is there, the particular matter, what | 1110.12
is its quantity, what is its quantity, it also contains | 1112.799
lead, it also contains benzene, it also | 1116.0
contains hydrocarbon, | 1118.559
when we monitor the quality of all these.  And | 1120.919
in any city we find that | 1123.44
the city is non-attainment and is not able to meet that target, | 1125.52
then we give it to the National Clean Mission | 1127.6
Program and to improve its quality, the | 1132.52
amount of 15 Finance Commissions which I have said is  Dipendra Singh HUDA by providing a program to improve the harmful quantity of air in that city. I | 1147.32
would like to ask the minister regarding air pollution. | 1150.159
According to the report published this year by IQ Air, the | 1152.84
world's 50 most polluted airs  There are | 1155.799
42 cities in our country, in India, | 1159.559
you have started the National Clean Air Program | 1162.44
and have given detailed information in it that the | 1164.88
government is concerned, the government is monitoring | 1166.84
and making plans in your answer, but | 1170.0
I do not see the allocation of budget anywhere in it.  Not | 1173.32
shown in your answer is there | 1175.799
enough budget for this serious problem as you | 1178.6
want is being allocated by the government to address this issue | 1183.48
what is the scope of those schemes and we | 1186.48
are seeing in NCR sir mostly the attention of the government | 1192.039
Instead of solving the problem through focused budget allocation, by imposing | 1195.44
penalty on those farmers who are in trouble burning, | 1197.6
vehicle pollution penalty | 1200.88
on those vehicles which are older than so many years, the | 1202.72
penalty is more on penal action but by | 1205.559
incentivizing along with penal action. | 1208.52
And the problem of burning should be solved by passing the budget. | 1213.28
Honorable Speaker Sir, the honorable member has talked about | 1217.72
this issue and we are | 1221.039
continuously working to improve the air quality in the 131 cities that we have selected. | 1233.52
We have | 1235.76
also written in our Ener 2 about the questions that have been raised about the NCR of Delhi, such as Swachh Bharat Mission, | 1238.6
Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban | 1241.48
Transformation, Smart City Mission, | 1244.64
Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable | 1246.88
Transportation System, Faster | 1249.2
Adoption.  And Manufacturing of | 1250.76
Hybrid and Electric Vehicles and Nagar | 1253.12
Van Yojana, if we look at all these schemes | 1255.52
collectively then they | 1257.2
come under this program. The government is | 1259.64
not trying to impose any penalty, the | 1261.96
government is making qualitative improvements in it | 1264.559
like in Delhi.  Under this, we have gone | 1267.84
from B4 to BS6 petrol to improve the air quality. To improve the air quality | 1271.919
in Delhi, | 1273.919
we have | 1275.6
built expressways so that the | 1278.12
main traffic of Delhi can go away from there. | 1281.08
For stubble, in our answer also  If you see, | 1283.96
we have written that we have built CHC centers, | 1286.6
provided machines for stubble harvesting, | 1289.159
also provided hiring facility to farmers, even in the | 1291.12
industrial pollution around Delhi, | 1293.64
we have | 1296.72
also diverted the industries to PNG. | 1304.6
We have worked to improve the quality of our DG sets etc. We have | 1309.08
also worked for air quality and waste management, | 1311.32
I have written in full detail in Anne Two. | 1313.679
I hope that the honorable members will look at it carefully. | 1315.559
Mr. Rajesh Mishra, | 1321.0
Honorable Speaker, I | 1324.44
want to ask the honorable minister through you, | 1330.48
what is the budget for hospital best management to prevent environmental pollution | 1332.88
and in the districts where incinerators are not installed | 1337.039
because  Incinerators are the best way to eliminate hospital base management. So in | 1341.76
how many districts are incinerators installed | 1344.76
and where are they not installed, | 1347.84
what is the further plan | 1349.12
so that pollution can be stopped due to hospital base management? | 1355.52

Commission.  The amount provided by the Ministry of Health | 1360.52
and the coordinated plan of various states is used to implement the | 1363.039
work. 131 cities also | 1368.4

Provide them | 1376.48
Shri C Kiran | 1382.799
Kumar Sir This is Regarding My Own Banagiri | 1386.52
Lok Sabha Constancy Sir There are | 1390.0
continuous pollution from pharma and | 1392.039
chemical industries 10 to 15 formula and | 1395.799
chemical industries are damaging ground | 1398.0
water soil and emitting chemical gases into | 1401.08
air and future  Companies which have been operated | 1404.76
by corporates and one of the members in the | 1407.6
Upper House also the Eran Ministry kept the | 1410.32
formation industries in non polluting | 1413.279
category and Central Government left the | 1415.96
penal action to the State Pollution Board if | 1419.039
the Boards do not take action which will save the | 1421.76
Ent and at the same time sir please conduct the | 1425.72
comprehensive impartial inspection with the | 1429.0
experts consisting of scientist from | 1431.799
CPCB and Indian Institute of | 1434.159
Chemical Technology and save the environment | 1436.6
sir because there are a lot of people | 1439.12
suffering even the cattle farmers really have a | 1442.4
dire situation as | 1444.12
witnessed by them. | 1445.919
Honorable | 1449.4
Minister, | 1451.159
Honorable Chairman, | 1453.799
Sir, the issue of pollution in different states is | 1457.919
because we have a federal | 1459.799
structure and hence the Central Pollution Control | 1462.88
Board gives directions and issues, | 1466.44
but the issues which are related to the management of the state are | 1470.279
done by the State Pollution Control Board.  If there is any case in a particular city | 1473.679
in which rules are | 1476.36
violated, then members can bring it to my notice | 1478.72
but the primary responsibility for this lies with the | 1480.48
State Pollution Control Board under the federal structure. | 1482.84
Mr. Rajeev Pratap Rudy | 1488.64
ji, please come here again and again sir. | 1493.64
But sir, when we are born and | 1498.96
from birth till our last breath, there is only one thing | 1503.039
in our body which keeps us going without any condition, | 1506.2
that is our heart, | 1509.52
sir, it does not need anything, it | 1511.72
needs fresh oxygen even if we cry.  Whether we are | 1513.84
awake, whether we are angry or sleeping, it | 1516.64
always does its work and God has given it | 1519.279
fresh air and oxygen. | 1522.08
My point is that there is something | 1524.799
about which we never think but it is the same | 1526.399
part of our life.  From birth till | 1529.0
death, he continues to serve himself without anyone asking, | 1534.84
he only needs oxygen | 1536.96
and he does not ask for anything and this | 1539.159
struggle is for the same oxygen. Speaker, Sir, the | 1542.52
list given is respected.  Minister ji and | 1544.919
he did a very good job, our government did | 1546.76
a lot, I have a question, there is a small town | 1549.6
which was Jaiprakash ji's village, the | 1551.96
report we have is published in Bihar, is it the | 1555.32
most polluted city among the cities of Rs 3 lakh?  There are | 1562.399
many such cities in the list that you have made | 1564.679
and this is applicable for the entire country, so | 1566.799
would you like to take any action especially to make Chhap pollution free by including Chhap in it | 1571.919
and such cities?  Those who have been left out, by | 1574.08
conducting a complete survey again, would | 1576.799
you like to include them and | 1578.72
benefit from the schemes? This | 1580.88
is my question. | 1584.159
Sir, Honorable Chairman, Sir, Honorable Members, I | 1589.039

education, what a small percentage.  Gets into the | 2854.96
excellent institution IIT admission | 2857.48
rate is 0.08 per cent of applicants so you're | 2860.88
looking at a country far beyond any shadow | 2863.2

students are trying to immigrate  We got | 2901.119
17 factors in the detailed survey that we | 2903.72
conducted of which is certainly the one we talk about lack of | 2906.52
access to high quality | 2908.2
institution. Another one undoubtedly is the | 2911.88
relative lack of academic freedom in Indian | 2914.68
campuses by comparison with foreign campuses as well as | 2917.599
of  Of course greater social | 2919.04

Respected Sir I thank you for | 3126.28
giving me this opportunity of raising | 3128.119
supplementary on the important topic I | 3131.16
thank you Noble Finance Minister Focusing on the importance of | 3134.76
the employment Announcing | 3137.4
employment | 3139.0
like get tds our youth  They Make Up Moran of | 3144.16
Our Total Population | 3146.48
by State Government of Andhra Pradesh | 3148.559
from 2019 to | 3151.44
2024 Failed Our Youth Mirably Leading to Our | 3155.28
State Having Constant High Percentage of Un | 3158.64
Employment as Compared to the National Average Our | 3162.559
Leaders Shri Nara Chandrababu Naid GAR & | 3165.96
Nara Lokesh GAR  Having strongly supported the need | 3169.04
of skill based census to determine the | 3172.04
ability of our youth according to the device | 3174.319
policy for their employment and skill | 3177.96
I would like to know from the noble minister while | 3181.839
the Union Government is | 3184.359
considering conducting a skill census for the | 3187.599
entire nation for the benefits.  Of our fresh | 3190.48
graduates, young professionals and our youth along | 3193.44
with the population of | 3200.04
census Honorable Speaker Sir, Honorable member has | 3204.079
asked a very important question | 3207.64
that skill development is | 3210.319
very important for employment, skilling is very important, | 3212.559
at present we see that in many | 3216.559
places  People say, youth say that we | 3219.48
need employment but employment is of their | 3222.2
choice that we get employment in one sector | 3224.48
but there are many such sectors, | 3227.079
today we can see that people | 3231.359
want plumber, plumber is not available to | 3234.52
work in the garage in the car.  There are | 3237.76
many jobs which | 3240.799
require skilling and hence skill | 3243.4
development is very necessary | 3246.079
and its gap and identification is how | 3266.559
manpower is required in the sector | 3268.88
and there is no skilling to skill it. | 3270.88
Arrangements are also made for the same | 3273.52
and the provision made in the current | 3275.68
budget of 2024-2525 is also very important. | 3278.44
In this, a total of 1000 such ITIs will be created in the country in | 3282.52
collaboration with the state government for skill development, | 3285.4
which will be in one field.  The | 3289.079
type of industries and the | 3292.28
type of skill man power required will be made | 3294.52
in the form of a hub, its syllabus will be made, a | 3298.2
course will be made and | 3300.599
skilling will be done as per the requirement so that the | 3303.359
skill man power is available. Another | 3305.4
important scheme has been announced in this budget itself. | 3307.92
That in the top 500 corporate | 3311.96
sector company of the country, one crore youth of the country will be | 3315.799
skilled there and will | 3318.839
get the opportunity to do internship, for | 3321.96
that they will also be given a scholarship so that | 3325.119
skill manpower can be created in the country and | 3328.96
meet the requirements of the country.  And | 3330.72
employment should also be generated. | 3337.839
Thank you speaker | 3340.48
sir through you I want to know from the noble minister | 3344.799
what steps have been taken by the government to | 3346.88
increase job creation in rural | 3349.92
India especially these will not only help | 3353.359
reduce migration to urban cities but | 3356.319
actively generate well.  Paying jobs for our | 3359.28
youth so that they may contribute to all | 3361.72
around development of villages and towns | 3364.599
especially in Andhra | 3368.2
Pradesh Speaker Sir, people go for employment | 3373.0
where there is opportunity, village people have | 3375.64
opportunity in the city, then people going to the city move | 3377.68
from one village to another.  People go to villages, | 3382.28
go from one state to another state for employment | 3384.319
and what is the type of employment. | 3387.28
What is the type of employment? If there is recruitment in any government | 3390.44
then | 3393.64
its people | 3397.119
can get employment by applying at the state level.  But there are many such | 3400.28
employment which | 3403.079
provide employment opportunity to the people in the rural areas. We have | 3405.64
launched the Vishwakarma Yojana. By skilling the | 3408.079
people doing small jobs at the rural level, they get the | 3412.48
opportunity of employment there. MNREGA scheme runs in | 3415.119
which people are given jobs in the villages only.  There is | 3417.72
no need to go to the city to get the opportunity | 3423.119
of employment, when the Government of India has taken many efforts to provide employment opportunities even in rural areas, the | 3425.359
result has been that the | 3431.319
report of the Periodic Labor for Survey PFF SL survey shows that | 3434.96
That the unemployment rate in rural areas | 3437.76
which was 5.33 in 20171 has | 3443.96
reduced to 2.4 in 222. This means | 3447.72
that employment opportunities in rural areas have increased in the last decade. | 3450.28
Similarly, the work | 3454.319
worker population ratio is also an | 3456.72
important factor.  In the survey also, there is a | 3458.96
big opportunity for employment in the rural areas, | 3461.96
which was 48.1 in 171. The worker population ratio has | 3466.48
increased to 59.4 in 2223, | 3472.0
that is, there | 3475.4
is a big opportunity for employment in the rural areas so that people can | 3478.48
earn their living by living in the villages. | 3481.28
Can Harendra Singh Malik do it for one | 3486.72
second Respected Chairman, I | 3489.559
want to ask the Honorable Minister through you, | 3492.28
whether the | 3494.799
industries that are established in rural areas that you have talked about about village employment, are the | 3499.92
salaries being given as per the Wage Board in those areas?  Is the | 3503.039
facility of skilling as many ITI skills as you said available | 3507.0
available anywhere till date and secondly, my | 3509.64
request is that would you please build a hostel for the workers who go from village to city and work as | 3512.52
laborers, | 3518.68
Honorable Speaker Sir, | 3522.24
in rural areas and urban areas?  The people living in the area are given | 3524.88
employment as | 3528.72
per their need and go there wherever they get opportunities. | 3531.119
Small jobs should be created in the rural areas. | 3544.359
Convert, that is why FPOs have | 3547.24
also been created in the agriculture sector, especially | 3549.4
in rural areas. Through 2 lakh | 3552.079
APOs, small businesses have started in rural areas. | 3567.039
Information has been received, | 3569.799
I have not given permission for any notice of adjournment motion, I will | 3575.359
give him time in zero hour, I will give him time in zero hour, I will give him | 3578.76
