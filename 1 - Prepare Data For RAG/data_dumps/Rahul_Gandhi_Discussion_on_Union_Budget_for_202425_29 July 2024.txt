2024 In my last | 47.6
speech I spoke | 50.64
about some concept Religious | 55.559
concept | 57.76
Shivji Concept of Ahimsa The fact that the | 61.64
Trishul is played behind  The back end is not | 64.68
held in the | 66.24
hand I spoke | 69.24
about the snake on Shivji's neck and I also said how religion | 76.64
in our | 79.0
country proposes the idea of ​​non | 82.479
violence and can be in cups in the | 86.96
phrase दरो मत दराओ मत | 92.72
and a also said त  There is an | 95.119
idea bound to the personal The idea | 99.439
of ​​the Abhaya Mudra transmits this notion of | 104.2
non-violence and affection and fearlessness to everyone | 116.2
Every | 121.92
aspect of our | 124.52
country my friends are | 126.88
smiling but they are also | 130.72
scared sir I am coming sir budget | 135.04
sir budget pa bol raha hoon | 136.68
sir sir you see the problem is sir in the | 140.36
BJP only one man is allowed | 143.44
to dream too  Be Prime | 145.08
Minister If the Defense Minister Decides He Wants | 147.8
to Be Prime Minister There | 150.12
is a Big Problem There is Fear | 152.519
So This Fear Has Been Spread Through | 155.84
Out the Country and the Question I Was Asking Myself Was Why is This | 159.56
Fear Spreading So Deep | 164.36
Why Is It  That My Friends in the BJP | 166.92
Are Terrified | 168.72
The Ministers Are Terrified The Farmers of | 172.319
India Are Terrified | 174.44
Workers Youngsters | 184.56
A I I thought about this a lot | 190.4
and I propose an answer | 193.92
Today Speaker Sir, thousands of years ago in | 202.08
Kurukshetra in Haryana, | 204.64
Abhimanyu was given to a young man.  Abhimanyu was | 211.4
killed by six people in Chakravyu, he was | 214.48
killed by trapping him in Chakravyu | 220.72
Sir, there is | 223.879
fear inside Chakravyu, there is | 226.4
violence | 229.12
and Abhimanyu was | 234.2
killed by six people after trapping him in Chakravyu, | 243.599
I did a little research about Chakra | 246.28
and found out | 247.879
that one of Chakravyu's  The second name | 251.879
is Padma Vyu which means Lotus | 256.239
Formation, so the Chakravyu, Speaker | 258.959
Sir, is in the shape of a Lotus, it is in the shape of a lotus flower. | 264.56
In the 21st century, Sir, a new Chakravyu has been prepared. | 273.12
Speaker Sir, it is also in the shape of a Lotus.  Sir, the | 276.56
Prime Minister walks with his symbol on his chest. | 280.479
Sir, what was done to Abhimanyu, when | 284.68
Abhimanyu was trapped in Chakravyu, has been | 286.759
done to India, to the | 289.039
youth of India, to the | 291.919
farmers of India, to our mothers and sisters. | 298.6
Sir Abhimanyu was killed by six people, | 302.28
their names were Dronacharya, | 307.24
Kana, Kripacharya, | 309.639
Varma, Ashwathama and | 315.36
Shakuni sir, even today there are six people in the middle of the Chakravyu, | 320.479
Sir, there are thousands of people in the Chakra at the very center of the Chakra. | 323.72
Yes sir, but | 326.08
six people control it at the very center, | 328.08
so just like six people were controlling it at that time, even | 331.08
today six people are controlling | 333.72
Chakravyu, Narendra Modi ji, Amit Shah | 338.8
ji, one minute, one minute please, | 342.96
no, you, you, you, sit, you.  Sit down, honorable | 349.639
member, you are on a constitutional post, many of your | 354.56
honorable members have written to me here | 357.8
that the name of the person who is not a member of the House, | 361.639
you have not given it in writing, | 365.8
do you follow it every | 378.72
minute, I am the leader of the opposition.  I | 382.319
would definitely expect from him that he does | 385.599
not expect anything from the rules and decorum of the House. | 388.88
Sir, if you want, Sir, then I, | 393.52
Honorable | 394.599
Member, I do not want. The | 397.919
House is run by the rules and procedures of the House. If you say, | 400.16
Nil | 403.02
[Music] | 409.48
[Applause] | 416.199
Let me give you all those | 420.4
please or you explain them to you | 425.039
Speaker Sir Speaker | 427.68
Sir The Chakravyu that has captured | 432.919
India has three forces behind it | 437.879
First | 439.68
is the idea of ​​monopoly capital that to people | 445.44
should be allowed to own the entire | 451.44
inno one element of Chakravyu I  Coming from | 455.16
the concentration of financial power the second | 458.639
element sir I am explaining the budget | 461.039
sir coming and | 464.84
coming one element i financial | 468.12
power the second element | 470.68
i the | 472.96
institution the agency CBI ED income | 478.879
text of this nation and the third i the | 482.68
Political Executive Skar S Three | 486.479
Together Are At Heart Of The Chakravyu And Dev | 491.52
Dated This Country My Expectation Was | 495.4
This | 497.28
Budget Would Bring The Power Of This | 500.759
Chakravyu This Budget Would Help Farmers Of This | 505.159
Country Would Help The Youth Of This Country | 509.639
Would Help The Labor The Small  Business as Country Business | 514.919
Budget Solemn Budget Its what is intended to | 521.76
strengthen this framework The | 525.68
Framework of Big Business Monopoly | 529.6
Business The | 531.32
Framework of a Political Monopoly Dist | 536.72
the Democratic | 538.44
Structure Finally the Framework of what one can | 543.0
call the Deep State and  The | 545.64
agency and the result of | 549.72
being the | 551.92
first, what did this Chakra do? | 556.92
Those who provide employment to India, there are | 560.88
small and medium businesses | 562.92
which used to provide employment to crores of youth. | 567.839
This Chakra did not do anything to them. | 570.68
How did demonetization, | 575.839
GST and tax terrorism happen?  People | 579.92
talk about terrorism all over the country. | 583.56
If any person runs a small business, he | 587.079
gets a phone call at night from the Income Tax | 590.56
Department about GST and | 593.64
he becomes a victim of tax terrorism. | 596.399
Budget to stop this tax terrorism.  If | 599.68
you have not done anything then | 604.8
because of the tax rim and your policies which | 608.72
helped big businesses during Covid and | 614.92
destroyed small and medium businesses, today the youth of India | 619.2
cannot get employment | 622.72
at all.  A youth cannot get employment. | 630.6
Now the Finance Minister is sitting. | 633.72
What did you do for the youth? | 639.32
In the budget, you talked about the internship program | 644.56
and this is probably a joke because you said | 649.639
that the internship program will be only | 652.0
in the 500 biggest companies of India and  99 But | 655.88
our youth have nothing to do with this internship | 659.639
program. There is no | 661.24
benefit to them. So first you | 663.56
broke your leg and you are trying to put a bed on top of it. The | 668.8
main issue | 671.04
today is the exam paper leak of the youth, | 675.24
wherever we are.  They go, you have | 679.88
created a cycle of unemployment for them | 682.16
and wherever we go they say, | 684.36
look, there is unemployment but there are paper leaks too, | 688.0
so you have one side paper leak cycle, the | 691.48
other side unemployment | 694.6
cycle view paper leak, I tell you | 697.36
70 in 10 years.  If you want to know, if you want to know, | 699.16
if you want to know, if it has happened 70 times in 10 years, then | 709.32
tell me about it. Sir, the | 717.24
Minister is speaking, the Minister is speaking, Sir, Sir, the | 724.04
Finance Minister did | 728.0
not say a word in the budget about the paper leak.  He has said that | 731.6
paper leak is the most important issue for the youth. He has not | 734.6
said a single word about paper leak. | 737.56
He did not say paper leak once and on the | 744.6
contrary, the money which should have been given in the education budget, | 749.48
you have given the least amount in 20 years. | 752.16
2.5 Off Budget | 755.959
Education Sir, on the other | 758.24
hand, on the other hand | 761.25
[appreciation] | 764.519
You are | 769.24
following me sir, doing running commentary | 774.27
[appreciation] On the | 776.32
other hand, for the | 779.48
first | 781.079
time, you have trapped the army soldiers in Agniveer's | 785.279
Chakravyu, | 788.24
in this budget one rupee for Agniveer's pension. | 792.639
No, | 795.8
you call yourself a patriot, but when it comes to | 800.12
helping Agniveer, when it comes to | 802.8
giving money to the soldiers, you do | 805.68
not see a single rupee in the budget. If you did not give one rupee | 807.959
for their pension, | 811.0
then you are a | 815.199
patriot to them. | 818.8
After getting trapped in the Chakravyu, the advice that Sir gives to get out of | 824.44
this Chakravyu, to | 827.04
get out of this Chakravyu, you | 829.759
made three black | 832.639
laws, you weakened the Land Tribunal Bill, | 836.68
you do not give them the right price, to | 839.72
come out of this Chakravyu, they  I have | 841.959
asked for only one thing from you, I have not asked for two things, I have | 844.88
asked for only one thing, they have said | 847.36
that we have legally guaranteed | 850.32
AMS, you have | 852.32
closed them at the border, stopped them, the | 855.279
road is closed till today, you are not ready to talk to them, | 858.639
they should come here with me.  You came to meet, you are | 861.079
not allowing them to come in. | 864.92
Honorable | 866.959
members, you do not tell the truth in the House, you do | 871.279
that one | 873.8
minute | 875.98
[applause] | 888.98
[applause] | 894.6
Come on sir | 896.6
tell me sir sir I will tell you sir second sir | 900.68
I will tell you the fact sir which | 902.839
I can in one second  I am telling you the facts, | 905.959
then you correct me. Speaker Sir, | 909.12
not the farmers' delegation. Sir, I am | 911.44
telling you the facts but tell your honorable members | 914.44
not to blame | 917.85
[praise] the House, I am speaking | 919.16
from the report, I am | 921.92
not making a report, | 924.04
speak, speak.  Let them speak. Let them speak. Let them speak. You speak. Let them speak. | 932.959
He spoke. Tell me. I will tell | 937.6
you. Sir, Second Speaker. I will | 940.959
tell you whatever I know. Sir, I will tell you. | 943.8
Second Speaker. Sir, what happened there, Sir, with | 948.92
me?  A farmer's delegation came to meet me. | 951.56
I was told that the farmer's delegation would not be | 954.0
allowed to come inside. When I went to meet him, he was allowed to | 957.24
come. Sir, this is the fact. | 960.92
Sir, now I don't know if there was any miscommunication, | 963.279
that is a different thing, but the fact is that when | 965.56
When I went there with the media, the doors | 968.12
of the Parliament were closed before they opened for them | 970.199
and you should ask them also, please please please please | 972.519
one minute, one | 977.36
minute please, that is why I am speaking | 980.6
on the arrangements of the House.  Questions should | 984.639
not be raised, who should come, please sit for a minute, who should be allowed to | 989.519
come, who should not be allowed to have a bonfire, this is the | 992.639
Jurisdiction of the Speaker, number | 996.279
one, when this information came, you met him inside, | 1000.92
but in that there was a violation of the decorum of the House, that | 1003.759
at some point in the House, the Honorable  No one other than the member | 1010.399
can give a byte. Yes and I give a byte in your presence. I | 1013.519
want to make it clear sir, this is a technique | 1016.24
sir, I did not know this | 1020.16
but | 1021.44
sir | 1024.559
please | 1026.89
[applause] | 1029.079
No Maan | 1032.799
Ro, you don't speak, your leaders are speaking.  So, | 1037.039
Speaker | 1038.679
Sir, you do not have the right to do son-son. | 1042.48
Honorable Leader of the Opposition, your sitting | 1044.28
members are commenting, then they say, why are the | 1045.959
people here commenting? We | 1047.959
wanted, we had our expectation that the one who | 1051.559
gives us is just one person from the government.  He is asking for a | 1055.559
legally guaranteed | 1058.039
MSP. We thought that this is not a big task. | 1060.88
Sir, this is not such a big task. We | 1063.96
thought that if the government had | 1070.64
made a provision for this in the budget, then | 1074.799
our farmers would have been able to  It was our thinking that those who are | 1076.76
trapped in your Chakravyu could have come out, | 1079.12
but you did not do so, | 1082.76
so I guarantee here on behalf of the India Alliance | 1085.559
that we will do this work and show that | 1089.6
what you did not do in your budget, I am the leader | 1093.48
of India.  I want to say to all the farmers, | 1095.4
we will pass the guaranteed legal MSP in this House and | 1101.88
give it to you. Speaker Sir, if you speak | 1109.08
good words to the middle class person, then | 1119.039
you will not do it, I am doing everything, | 1125.96
please | 1129.24
obey sir, middle class person.  And perhaps he used to | 1135.2
support the Prime Minister before this budget. When the | 1139.4
Prime Minister asked him to play the thali during the Covid period, | 1142.76
he played the thali by pressing ' | 1146.0
Dh Dha Dha, play the thali, play the thali'. | 1149.679
We found it strange but when the Prime Minister | 1153.72
ordered the middle class, then the middle class did the same. | 1155.52
After that, the | 1159.2
Prime Minister told the same middle class to | 1162.28
turn on the lights of the mobile phones and the lights of the mobile phones were | 1164.64
lit. The | 1167.919
middle class all over India turned on the lights of the mobile phones. | 1170.919
Now in this budget, you have seen a knife from the same middle class.  The | 1183.2
indexation that you canceled was a | 1187.44
stab in the back and the capital gains tax that you | 1191.0
increased was a stab in the chest that | 1193.0
you increased the long term capital gains tax | 1197.12
from 10 to 12. Chest here  It is sad to kill or | 1201.24
stab the short term at 15 to 20 rupees | 1207.76
but there is | 1212.4
a hidden benefit for the India alliance in this. The middle | 1217.6
class is now going to leave you and is | 1220.08
coming to this side. | 1222.159
So I say wherever you get a chance. | 1225.24
You get a chance to create a cycle, you get a chance, you | 1229.36
create a cycle, we do the | 1232.039
work of breaking the cycle, the | 1235.08
farmer's loan is waived off in our budget, if you break the cycle, MNREGA breaks the cycle, | 1238.36
then we do the work of breaking the cycle, | 1242.12
you do the work of creating a cycle. | 1244.2
Yes, you want that India should | 1249.4
live in small squares and the poor people of India should not be able to dream. | 1257.28
Just what sir, | 1259.919
sir, how should I say sir, honorable member, one | 1263.72
minute, one | 1265.0
minute, one minute, one | 1268.559
minute, honorable members, your one | 1272.64
minute, your deputy leader, me.  Letters have been given in writing | 1276.24
that any honorable member who is | 1279.44
not a member of this House should not comment about him. | 1281.279
Look at me, that's why Speaker Sir, | 1286.24
Speaker Sir, Sir Sir, I want to ask you a question, do | 1290.159
n't ask me a question, | 1292.44
you are sorry.  Sir, Sir, I am Sir, then I | 1296.72
say Sir, three and four. Three and four are | 1299.919
fine. | 1300.88
[Praise] | 1303.0
Sir, if I can't take the name now, I will have to say something. | 1305.76
Sir, I say three and four. Give some other | 1307.44
number to the honorable member.  Please tell me why you wrote a | 1309.6
letter to me sir. | 1312.76
When you attack the former Chief Minister of Haryana like this, | 1317.72
you sent us a letter on the reference of the former Chief Minister of Haryana. | 1320.919
You want to link a former Chief Minister with two industrialists and | 1323.48
a farmer leader of Haryana | 1326.34
[Praise.  ] | 1334.679
That you have written this letter to me about his | 1337.76
dignity, | 1339.559
he is not allowing you to speak, you are allowing him to | 1342.4
speak | 1347.39
[praise] | 1350.96
One minute please, you are the leader of the House, you are the | 1355.44
leader of the opposition, it is the expectation of the House | 1358.24
that we are the leaders of the House.  Maintain decorum discipline and | 1362.32
increase it, therefore, whatever topic you put forward should be | 1365.96
kept in the rules and procedures. Speaker Sir, | 1369.36
but how should I say this, | 1374.4
how should I give the indication of these people, Sir, please tell me, Sir, there is | 1377.6
some other way, if you do not want to | 1380.36
take names, then please do so.  Give me another method | 1383.799
Sir Mr. | 1386.29
[Music] | 1388.919
Minute, don't share your knowledge, he is knowledgeable | 1392.6
Sir, A1, A2 will do, | 1395.919
Sir | 1397.59
[applause] | 1399.32
Honorable Leader of Opposition, I am | 1402.32
again expecting you to at least | 1405.72
follow the rules and procedures | 1409.24
in the House.  You are the leader of the opposition, | 1414.52
Mini Nay | 1420.29
[applause] | 1434.52
Oli, so the expectation from everyone is that who said you please | 1440.6
sit down, do you know what is point of fear, | 1443.48
please sit down, your leader is saying | 1445.44
point of fear, please speaker, sir, | 1448.64
please | 1451.44
sit down for a minute, speaker.  Sir, these two people, | 1457.799
Sir, they | 1464.36
control the infrastructure and business of India. Sir, they have | 1467.24
the airport, the | 1469.08

have to speak about him, Sir, if you tell us.  If | 1515.0
you cannot speak about these two | 1516.76
then it is not acceptable for us | 1518.6
sir, we have to speak, now if you | 1520.96
want not to take their names then give us some other system | 1525.7
[appreciation] | 1528.919
Parliamentary Affairs Minister please | 1540.35
[appreciation]  ] You | 1546.48
plead and do | 1548.84
not agree, you challenge the Speaker, | 1552.84
you do not know the rules, being a member of this House, it is | 1558.799
important to know the rules, the leader of each party does | 1562.559
not know about the rules of the House, it is | 1565.36
very sad that we all  He is | 1569.84
a member of the House and the Lok Sabha is governed by rules. | 1573.559
Today, by challenging the Speaker of the House, the Leader of the Opposition has | 1578.12
degraded this dignity. This is not how the | 1581.6
country is governed. The House is governed by the rules. It is | 1585.2
governed by the Constitution. It does not happen | 1589.73
[applause] | 1612.51
[music] | 1614.159

I asked him a question: | 1753.12
Speaker | 1755.36
Sir, I stood up with the Speaker's permission. | 1758.2
Bakul said: You said, I did | 1761.48
not speak forcefully. You are saying, I | 1763.88
took permission from Speaker Sir, or did I | 1768.159
not do so? That's why I felt that I should tell you | 1771.2
that you should meet the Prime Minister. | 1774.72
You disturbed me till the speech and did not allow me to speak. Today | 1777.799
we are asking you to yield for 10 seconds. | 1781.159
You are saying that we will not yield. | 1783.519

See | 1851.48
All All All  People, you are disturbing the leader of the opposition | 1854.72
and I am disturbing you again and again. | 1858.72
Ven Gopal ji, everyone is causing | 1861.36
disturbance. Please note that through this | 1865.159
scheme, | 1869.559
Speaker Sir, there are | 1873.88
about 73 | 1878.639
people in the country who are Dalits, tribals and backward classes.  And | 1884.399
this is the | 1886.919
main power and strength of India | 1889.72
and the truth is that they do not get a place anywhere, they do | 1895.96
not get a place in business, they do | 1898.799
not get a place in corporate India, they do | 1904.159
not get a place in governments, | 1911.32
see this | 1913.679
sir one minute one minute one  Minute one minute per | 1918.799
minute one | 1920.08
minute I had expected you earlier too, now | 1924.08
you are the leader of the opposition, it is your constitutional | 1926.44
responsibility, | 1932.36
you have turned the TV on, sir, no no, there is no one, | 1943.919
show it, please listen, okay | 1949.0
sir, no, you, no, no, Apollo you.  It | 1954.48
will be seen for Apollo that you are the leader of the opposition, | 1957.279
so my expectation is that sir, | 1959.32
see this, sir, you have violated the dignity of the House | 1962.35
[praise] | 1965.24
and sir, whenever I want to remove him, I have to | 1968.08
do this, sir, see that | 1969.79
[praise]  Come, | 1973.799
sir, are you afraid of the photo? Are you afraid of Shivji's photo? Sir, I will not allow the | 1979.08
poster to come. This is the | 1980.84
wrong way, I will not allow the poster to come, I will not | 1984.679
allow the poster to come, it is wrong in the house, | 1990.039
Sir, Sir, it is not wrong to show the photo, | 1995.12
Sir, with your permission, with permission, Sir, I am doing | 1999.12
this.  I want to show the photo, Sir, I | 2001.32
want to explain that there is no permission in the rule. Okay, Sir, | 2003.76
I want to explain this photo. Sir, this | 2006.24
halwa of the budget is being distributed in it, | 2010.36
and in this photo, Sir, I do not see an OBC officer. | 2013.399
Not a single tribal officer is | 2015.2
visible. Not a single Dalit officer is visible. | 2018.639
What is happening to me, sir? The country's halwa is | 2022.639
being distributed, sir, and there is not even one per 73 in it. | 2026.159
Sir, you people are eating the halwa and the rest of the | 2029.639
country is getting the halwa.  It is not | 2033.48
okay sir 20 people 20 officers have | 2038.48
prepared the budget we have found out 20 calm | 2041.519
down | 2042.6
[applause] | 2044.88
please sir 20 officers have their names I have them | 2049.079
if you want the names I will give them 20 | 2051.399
officers have prepared the budget of India  What has been done | 2055.32
means that 20 | 2059.76
people have done the work of distributing the pudding of India. | 2061.8
Now Speaker Sir, out of those 20 people, out of | 2067.919
90 people, there | 2072.28
are only two, one minority and one OBC and there | 2075.32
is not even one in this photo.  That is, in the photo, | 2077.839
you turned it back | 2080.04
and did not allow anyone to come in the photo, | 2084.24
and I wanted the | 2088.639
issue of caste census to be raised in the budget, the whole | 2093.8
country wants 90, but India | 2097.96
wants 95 caste census, who wants Dalits? | 2100.68
Tribal people want it, backward class | 2103.839
people want it, poor general caste people want it, | 2107.2
minority people want it, everyone wants it because everyone has to find out | 2111.56
how much is our participation, how much is our share | 2114.09
[music] | 2116.16
but sir, I am seeing sir, the government keeps | 2119.8
distributing halwa.  It is being distributed, it is being distributed, | 2121.48
and who is distributing, the same | 2126.44
people on the doti, and who is distributing it, the same is | 2131.16
on the doti, and the rest of India is on 90. The | 2134.88
Finance Minister is smiling looking at India, it is | 2139.0
amazing, this is not a laughing matter, | 2142.079
madam, this is not a laughing matter.  This is the caste | 2145.359
census. | 2147.0
This is the caste census. This will change the country. | 2150.52
[Praise] | 2156.16
will come | 2158.64
to you sir, this sir sir, this lotus sir, those who | 2165.44
have Padma, Chakravyu is also called Padma Vyu, | 2168.359
those who have Padma, they have a wrong | 2170.68
understanding.  The youth of the country think that the | 2174.56
backward people of the country are Abhimanyu. The backward people of the country are | 2176.56
not Abhimanyu, it | 2179.72
is Arjun and they are going to break your Chakravyu and | 2183.28
throw it away. | 2185.96
India alliance has taken the first step [ | 2187.58
Music] | 2188.8
India alliance has taken the first step.  We have taken away the | 2191.599
confidence of your Prime Minister, we have blown it, | 2194.24
that is, your Prime Minister is not able to come to the speech | 2198.68
and I tell you in advance that he will | 2201.92
never come to my speech, | 2207.319
Sir, what is the mistake in this, Sir, tell me one thing | 2213.11
[praise] | 2215.24
Sir, Sir.  So those people with Padma, sir, those with | 2222.119
lotus formation, they have | 2225.04
not understood the nature of India. | 2229.0
Violence and | 2231.8
hatred are not the nature of India. Chakravyu is | 2236.0
not the nature of India. | 2238.88
Nature of India is different. | 2241.76
Now I want to make you about the nature of India.  In every religion, there is a | 2244.16
formation against Chakravyu. | 2248.119
In every religion, you know what is the | 2251.119
opposite of Chakra in Hindu religion. Do you know what is the opposite of Chakra in Hindu religion? | 2254.88
I will tell you that there is a | 2257.2
procession of Shiva. Anyone can come in Shiva's procession. | 2259.8
Any person of any religion | 2263.16
can come, can | 2264.599
come in the procession, can dance, can sing, can | 2269.16
see his dream. If we | 2277.68
talk about Sir Guru Nanak Ji, | 2278.72
then no one can be stopped from serving, no | 2282.04
one can be excluded from the langar.  Can't be thrown | 2287.4
sir, in Islam anyone can come to the mosque, anyone can enter the | 2290.599
church, anyone | 2293.28
can enter the church, anyone can come to the temple, sir, | 2296.599
but there are only six people in their Chakravyu, | 2299.48
sir, so this fight is like Shiva's procession and  We are | 2303.68
in the middle of Chakravyu, we | 2305.4
break the pride, | 2308.68
we work to break the Chakravyuha, | 2311.96
MNREGA, Green Revolution, Independence Constitution, | 2315.88
this is the work of breaking the Chakravyuha, this brings | 2321.0
happiness in the country, removes fear, | 2325.92
gives confidence, you | 2329.4
do the work of making Padma Vyu Chakravyuha, | 2333.88
Chakravyuha Shiv  That the procession cannot be defeated, | 2338.079
you look at your history, you call yourself a | 2340.04
Hindu, you call yourself a Hindu, you do | 2344.0
not understand the Hindu religion | 2345.32
[praise], | 2351.24
you are the people who make Chakravyu, you are a Hindu, a | 2358.0
bogus | 2360.119
bogus speaker, sir, so in the end I | 2363.2
I want to say this, calm down now, I am ending, | 2365.72
sir, don't be afraid, don't be | 2369.68
afraid, | 2371.76
speaker, | 2375.319
sir, a few months ago, | 2384.76
I am the one who made you Chakravyu Speaker Sir, | 2387.4
Chakravyu | 2390.64
[praise], | 2391.88
no, no, I did not insult you, I did not | 2394.839
insult you.  I didn't do it, I can't do it, I ca | 2397.48
n't ever insult you till I die. What are you | 2399.96
talking? | 2401.68
What are you talking about? | 2406.119
Sir, you have made these small cycles, | 2410.0
I try to understand them in my | 2412.8
own small way.  A | 2416.76
few months ago, | 2419.4
I worked with Badhaiya for six to seven hours. | 2423.04
Vishwakarma ji was there. I asked him a | 2426.2
question. | 2428.2
I told him what makes you sad, | 2431.48
what makes you feel pain. | 2435.319
He told me, | 2438.04
Rahul, listen to me, you will understand. | 2441.8
Listen, | 2443.04
understand, sir, you are interrupting sir | 2449.07
[appreciation] | 2452.0
Now you interrupt so much and while speaking while | 2454.88
sitting, you get caught | 2457.359
in the bell during the entire speech, you ask questions about | 2459.88
interrupting sir, so I | 2464.24
asked Vishwakarma ji that you have been here for | 2467.96
years. | 2471.96
You have been doing work for many years in the whole country, if you | 2475.119
look, you will find it, you will | 2478.2
not find it in your home, you | 2482.64
will find it in the whole country, then I asked him Vishwakarma ji, what | 2485.8
causes you pain, what | 2489.28
causes sadness, then he said, | 2491.119
Rahul.  I am making this table | 2493.92
but Rahul ji said now Rahul ji said now I did | 2500.8
n't like that I did | 2504.599
n't like it but said it is the truth then he said | 2507.839
Rahul | 2509.48
ji I feel sad about this | 2512.76
I feel sad about this  I | 2517.28
make this table but | 2521.2
I cannot go inside the showroom where this table is kept. A | 2526.68
few days ago, | 2530.079
on the way to Sultanpur, I sat with a cobbler brother and | 2536.0
asked him this question: What are you sad about?  What happens is that | 2539.24
Rahul | 2541.079
ji says that | 2544.079
only my father respected me and | 2547.28
no one else | 2550.48
did, so I say sir, this | 2553.88
Chakravyuh that you have created, | 2555.319
crores of people are being harmed by this Chakravyuh, it is | 2559.16
causing pain and we are destroying | 2562.28
this Chakravyuh.  We are going to break it and the | 2565.64
biggest way of breaking it which you people are | 2568.88
afraid of and tremble with is the caste census and | 2572.2
just as I had said that the India Coalition will | 2575.76
pass the Guaranteed Legal MSP in this House, | 2580.44
similarly I am saying that whether you like it or not, the | 2583.76
census would be done.  By passing it in this House, | 2589.88
we will | 2596.48
show you who is opposing, | 2599.24
who is opposing, why are you | 2602.2
commenting while sitting, why are you | 2604.48
commenting while sitting, then they will comment | 2607.359
Speaker Sir, these small notches from the caste census. | 2610.16
You have created this system, you have | 2613.319
created the system of Chakravyu, it | 2616.16
will break and for this we will work with all our strength, the | 2619.96
whole India alliance will do this work. | 2622.04
Thank you Jai | 2628.2
Hi Rajnath Singh | 2630.88
Ji, Speaker | 2632.839
Sir Speaker Sir Leader of Opposition | 2637.24
regarding the budget.  Whatever misconceptions have been created, | 2639.8
when the Finance Minister will stand to give answers related to the budget, | 2646.28
whatever clarification has to be given regarding those misconceptions, | 2649.359
whatever message has to be given to the country and she will | 2651.48
give the message on her own behalf because I believe that there are | 2653.88
many misconceptions in the budget. | 2656.599
But | 2661.2
this is such a | 2663.8
sensitive issue regarding the security of this country | 2667.359
and the security of our Agniveer soldiers associated with the army, who are in the hands of the brave soldiers who protect the country's borders. | 2671.52
Efforts are being made in that regard, | 2674.04
I would like to say that Mr. Aksh, whenever there is your | 2676.88
order, I am fully prepared to | 2680.119
give a statement regarding my agenda before this House. | 2686.72
Vishnu | 2689.66

minute. On the topic of Agniveer, he said that | 2718.4
I am ready to discuss the entire topic. | 2720.72
Sir, the Defense Minister said that | 2726.079
Even before I raised the issue of Agniveer, the Defense | 2729.119
Minister had said | 2731.92
that | 2736.72
compensation has been given to the families of martyr Agniveer and he | 2740.839
said in the House that compensation of one crore rupees has been given | 2744.319
but sir, that was wrong. Yes sir, that | 2749.079
martyr family has been given insurance. | 2752.079
Sir, I | 2755.079
want to say this, sir, this is the truth, sir, and | 2759.16
