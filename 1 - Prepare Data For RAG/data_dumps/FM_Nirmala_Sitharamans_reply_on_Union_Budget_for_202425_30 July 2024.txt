address almost all the issues raised by the | 139.879
male members and I shall go by issue that would | 143.239
cover many members under each issue but I will try to name as many of them as | 148.2
possible so I will just before I do the part | 153.239
generally responding to  The Noble Members I would | 155.959
like to highlight some of the | 158.599
Budget point features which are very important for us to | 162.44
understand how this Budget fits in itself | 165.68
in the long path towards developed India | 170.12
Sir this Budget actually does what it was mentioned | 174.12
in the Vote on Account  So Ashley Ifu Into | 178.84
It Everything Almost Everything Said In The | 181.959
Vote On Account And After That Of Course | 185.2
Brings A New Edition Towards Making | 187.92
This Year The First Step Towards The | 190.319
Next Five Years Leading Towards Bic | 192.36
With India So The Continuity From The Vote On | 196.36
Account Is Something  That I like to | 199.159
underline the principle of governance has | 202.239
since 2014 been Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas Sabka | 206.28
Vishwas and Sabka Prayas and following that we shall come | 210.56
forward and work together to make us | 214.959
overcome the | 216.879
difficulty the budget actually seeks to | 219.879
consolidate the entire impact  It | 224.12
outlines measures in order to overcome the challenge | 229.239
and two core elements have been highlighted | 232.92
one social | 234.92
inclusive by enriching all strata of | 238.079
people in the society and geographical | 241.799
inclusive through inevitable | 244.56
development for all the regions in our country so we are | 248.4
taking  A whole of nation approach and | 251.879
now seeking to make sure that we fulfill the | 255.04
aspirations of our people so brief if I way to | 258.68
surprise on points that we are meeting this | 263.8
objective that we have set before our sales | 266.72
is expenditure of the government has actually grown | 269.72
exponentially  It is | 274.16
today | 275.639
48.2 lakh Curse it is projected to grow by | 279.44
about 7.3 over 2324 and | 284.039
88.5 over pre actuals of | 287.6
2324 We call it pre actuals but the | 290.68
final figures are almost there because it | 293.08
has to be certified and audited We give the | 295.36
nomenclature | 299.68
real | 301.199
Rs  With in the a with in the total | 305.759
expenditure sir one feature which | 309.639
marked India's growth story post the | 312.8
Covid it is the capital expenditure which is the | 316.68
public money with which we are building | 318.72
assets meaning governments own expenditure | 321.96
to build assets to build capital | 324.24
expenditures are the one  Capital Expenditure | 327.4
is the One Which Judge Actually Enables Us to Come | 330.24
Out of Covid While Many Other Countries | 333.479
in the World Are Doing Very Many Different | 335.919
Things But Yet This One Tested Formula of | 340.4
Depending on the Multiplier Which Comes | 342.479
Out of Spending on Public Expenditure | 345.0
Spending on Capital  Expenditure through | 346.759
public money has actually yielded as true | 349.88
results that post Covid | 352.919
we have consistently maintained high growth rate and we are the | 355.919
fastest growing in the world as a | 358.24
result of this very clear government | 362.08
approach and in the total expenditure of Rs 48.2 | 366.24
lakh 11.11 lakh go for capital. | 377.039
Expenditure Sur Budgeted Capital Expenditure | 380.96
Now Almost 3.3 Times The Capital | 384.639
Expenditure Which Was There In | 387.319
201920 That Is Prior To Covid If | 390.639
You Actually Calculate The Effective | 392.88
Capital | 394.039
Expenditure That Is The Sum That Is Referred To One | 397.599
The Budgeted Capital Outlay And The Grants And | 400.479
Aid For  Creation of capital assets | 403.8
given to the status grants ad go to the | 407.199
status capital account but it remains in the | 409.479
revenue account for us but because it | 412.0
also creates capital in the status name if we were to | 415.199
calculate the effective capital | 418.52
expenditure Tk 15.02 lakh  And AB 18 | 424.479
over the RE of | 427.0
2324 so that is the impetus we are giving for | 430.56
growth to be sustainable and for us to | 433.52
retain the growth rate that we have been very | 436.759
clearly paying tribute to the hard work | 439.08
of the people of this country I'm not  Getting | 441.4
into the details of the revenue expenditure | 443.56
because that is already in the budget document | 446.8
but more | 448.16
important I get into talking about the | 451.08
allocation because I think a lot of members have said probably | 453.52
the allocation in the social | 457.599
sector has come down I want to by giving | 461.28
The Data I Want To Show Case To The Ministers | 464.52
To The Rebel Members That The Expenditure On The | 468.479
Country Has Gone Up In Every One Of Them And I Will | 471.12
Show By How Many So Agriculture And Allied | 474.4
Sector In 2013 And 14 Had Just Rs | 480.8
30M Crore  Now it is | 485.56
1.52 lakh | 490.039
Crore in 8000 Crore moran the last year was 2324 | 496.039
so even over last year we made increase and | 499.36
not but | 501.319
reduction so Education and Employment and | 504.599
Skilling Next one sir in Ch 0.85 Lakh | 510.319
was estimated for Education Employment and | 512.599
Skilling in 2013  14 Versus Today It Is | 517.399
1.48 Lakh Crore Ch E 23 Par More Allocation Even | 523.68
Over The Last Year 28000 Crore Moran Last Year | 527.2
Ch E 23 More Allocation Compared To Even Last Year | 532.16
In 10 Years 0.85 Lakh Crore To 1.48 Lakh Crore | 539.68
Women & Girls 0.96 Lakh Crore  In 1314 | 544.72
it is Rs | 545.8
3.27 lakh crore more allocation at 41 and | 552.0
96000 crores more than the last year Rural | 555.839
Development including Infrastructure sir | 559.64
0.87 lakh crore and this year in that is | 563.64
2013 and 14 whereas this year it is 2.66 lakh | 568.0
crores which is 11.  7 Per More Allocation over the | 572.72
last year 28000 crores more than the last | 575.64
year Urban Development was only 0.12 lakh | 580.64
crores in 2013 14 Where as it is close to a | 584.76
lakh crores now 7000 crores more than last | 588.6
year Health and Social Welfare Sir 0.72 lakh | 593.04
crores  In 20131 it is now | 596.2
1.46 lakh crore 3000 crore more than the last | 600.32
year if so nowhere with the budget given less | 605.16
allocation than the previous year so I would like | 608.68
to appeal to the rebel members to please have a | 611.8
look at the document in full and see that no. | 614.519
Allocation has been reduced Sir Just Brief | 619.04
What the Budget 2024 25 Tries to bring in a | 623.0
balance among several objectives because | 626.36
growth is important and through better growth | 629.68
Higher growth we believe in quality can be addressed so | 632.6
growth employment welfare | 636.279
spending capital investment and fiscal | 639.8
consolidation  These are the factors that we try | 642.76
to balance in the budget so the end | 646.959
indicator that is very important for us if I am | 649.839
insisting on | 651.399
doing public spending on capital | 654.48
expenditure is the quality of public | 656.8
spending is the revenue deficit fiscal | 659.72
deficit ratio normally from about 80 | 663.68
in 2020.  2021 Covid year on account of Covid | 668.079
deficit to fiscal deficit ratio | 671.639
sir was expected to fall to 36 per | 676.12
for was very high it has now | 680.32
fallen to it is expected to fall to 36 | 683.32
per in 2425 and there for reflecting the | 687.44
fact that  Expenditure is Quality Asset | 692.079
Creation No One Can Refute This Data Sir Are | 695.279
Available in Public Domain and the Other Thing That is an | 699.68
Important Indicator I Promise in | 703.959
Sauce | 705.079
212 The Government Ever to Atton Fiscal Deficit | 709.36
to GDP Level Below | 713.2
4.5 by the Year | 715.519
256 FM N  Unpainted High of 99.2 in | 722.48
2020 | 724.12
2021 We Have Kept Completely to the | 728.56
Trajectory Projected We Have Not Detained from | 731.6
It We Are Compliant by That Fiscal | 734.839
Deficit Tractor Given by Me Even Today You See That | 737.959
We Got Close to 4.6 Actually This | 741.76
Year We Have Clearly  Given 4.9s the fiscal | 744.639
deficit so we are keeping a word on that | 747.68
India's exceptional post pandemic economic | 751.959
recovery to become the fastest growing | 754.8
economy over the last three years is truly | 759.839
magnesium | 772.56
l of us because of their toil and | 776.639
hard work and belief that  They have to | 778.72
bring | 779.639
the situation for the families to be better has | 782.48
resulted in India becoming the fastest | 785.32
growing economy and how many nations may | 788.8
ask this year how many nations have achieved | 792.44
this balance through the budget since post Covid | 796.32
to retain that growth in an sure  That this | 799.36
balance happens and continues that a | 803.44
sustainable growth momentum so attest these sort of things which have to be | 806.8
a | 809.24
memory for the sake of thanking our people I | 812.16
would like to highlight this as the last few | 815.0
years achievement of this government and | 817.519
enthrall the people of  India and this could have been | 820.399
possible unless there is a hard | 822.839
working visionary leadership which takes us | 825.959
forward so that the country can really come out | 829.959
of the Covid distress and I thank the | 832.519
Prime Minister for his leadership on | 837.68
this Sir I have also | 841.759
presented the Jammu and Kashmir  Budget for | 845.32
2425 I am happy to outline the concrete | 849.48
steps that have been taken to enable the Union | 852.8
Territory to break free from the fears of | 855.279
the past Namely the legacy of fiscal | 858.639
distress that has been there | 860.92
while the State we have provided | 864.639
substantial financial support and will | 868.12
give  The number 17000 crores in the Union Budget | 872.04
of the UT of JNK this year it | 875.24
includes 12000 crores towards financing | 878.6
the cost of Jammu Kashmir Police is a | 881.0
burden we want to take on our shoulders so that | 883.6
JNK is very flexible to spend | 886.519
money for developmental  Activities and the | 889.519
Additional Central Assistance of Rs 5000 crore has | 893.079
been provided with this support I | 896.16
expect the GSDP ratio fiscal deficit | 899.12
set to GSTP ratio of the Union | 901.36
Territory would be some way and I am estimator | 905.12
some way in the range of 3 at 2425 for the year | 908.399
The public finances of the Union | 911.16
Territory are now back on the rails and they are now | 914.68
able to focus on developmental activities | 918.279
much more than ever before and the fiscal | 921.399
prudence is the biggest spirit with which | 925.04
the welfare activities are being taken up | 927.399
without any compromise on  Sabka Saath | 930.079
Sabka Vikas So because Jammu and Kashmir | 934.16

record of this unemployment rate | 968.519

big issue they all know the presented budget in | 1842.12

agricultural allocation comes | 1918.48
down and legal | 1923.36
guarantee for | 1925.159
MSP This has also been spoken by Moran | 1929.32
20 speakers Narbal 20 members have spoken | 1933.919
I just labored I don't know Narbal Minister Shivraj | 1939.12
ji  Been answering lot of questions related | 1941.519
to agriculture last few days they may be some | 1944.44
rep in my statement but I like to | 1946.96
highlight so the budget allocation for the | 1949.6
Department of Agriculture and Farmers | 1951.44
Welfare was only Rs | 1954.919
2134 crores in 2013 14 131 crores only Rs | 1963.039
2134 crores  Allocation for agriculture | 1967.84
but now in 2425 it has increased from 1 lakh 23 | 1974.72
lakh to 1.23 lakh crore. | 1979.919
Five times increase, Sir Sir, more than | 1984.36
3.2 lakh crores have been dispersed to over | 1989.519
11 crore farmers under the PM Kisan Sins. | 1994.12
It's | 1995.36
Rs 3.24 Lakh Crore Has Been Dispersed For | 2000.36
11 Crore Farmers So Institutional | 2003.639
Credit Targets For Agriculture Have | 2006.08
Increased More Than 2.5 Times 2014 15 It | 2012.039
Was Rs 8 Lakh Crore Now It Is Rs 20 Lakh Crore | 2016.279
Farmers Are Getting This Money Institution Credit | 2019.639
Interest Sub Subsidy  Is also | 2023.24
being given to farmers it has increased 2.4 | 2026.84
times. | 2028.519
In 201415, | 2033.32
farmers used to get loans from banks with interest subsidy of Rs. 6000 crores. | 2037.08
Now it has increased to Rs. | 2040.279
14252 crores. Sir, this year | 2044.88
2324 number of accounts of small and | 2048.2
marginal farmers are available agricultural | 2050.8
loans.  Grown from | 2053.76
57 to | 2055.599
76. Agriculture farmers used to take loan at Rs. 57 in 14, | 2060.679
now they are taking loan at Rs. 76 with subsidy, | 2065.159
that is why this number will increase further because | 2068.399
our efforts are going well with the farmer. | 2070.96
Sir, also the committee has been consumer | 2077.399
how the CACP cost.  Agricultural Commission | 2081.96
for Agricultural Costs and Prices can | 2085.0
work better so that how to work in the | 2088.24
best way to provide whatever facilities should be available to the farmer, | 2091.96
this | 2094.879
committee is working on that. Sir I want to | 2099.599
highlight if anything I am tired of many of the | 2102.359
speakers.  Ready Said But I Like To Highlight | 2104.76
This Point | 2109.44
Today | 2111.52
Sir The Congress Party And India's Allies | 2115.28
Partners Are Doing Good Lot Of Politics | 2119.2
On The Farmers I Say It With Consideration Sir I | 2123.96
Am Not Speaking Lose The National Union | 2127.839
Farmers M S Swaminathan Had Recommended | 2131.76
In  2006 Minimum Support Price should be at Rs | 2136.2
50 per more than the weighted average cost of | 2139.24
production This was not accepted by the | 2142.599
UPA Government The Cabinet Note was | 2146.079
drafted in July | 2147.839
2007 Said and I quote Sir MSP is | 2151.76
recommended by the CACP on objective | 2155.28
criteria considering the  Variety of | 2157.8
factors evolved there for setting an | 2161.16
increase setting an increase of atleast 50 | 2165.04
on the cost may cause distortion in the | 2169.76
market in some cases there may be a | 2172.92
mechanical linkage between MSP and cost | 2176.96
of production on the producer saying this by | 2181.16
MS Swaminathan  The | 2185.2
UPA government side-lined the report | 2188.92
in 2007 and again in the 2004 manifesto. Congress | 2193.359
party says that it will bring a comprehensive | 2196.44
crop insurance, but in reality, | 2199.359
who is the PM who will bring PM Fasal Bima Yojana? | 2202.68
Sir, we are our Prime Minister Modi ji. | 2206.92
Then the Congress party  It was also said that it would | 2211.56
examine the feasibility of direct income | 2214.2
support to farmers, but | 2217.68
who is going to bring Kisan Samman Nidhi in 2019, Sir, Honorable | 2221.0
Prime Minister Modi ji, that is why Congress | 2225.16
party can go on shedding crocodile | 2228.599
tires about farmers, | 2232.319
no one has done anything in implementation in the last 10 years.  Came from above in a year, got even | 2236.04
for several decades, | 2239.68
did nothing. The Failure of the Flagship Loan | 2243.28
Waiver. Sir, wanted to talk about the failure of loan waiver 2008. | 2258.839
CAG talked so much about the loan waiver for farmers in the 2008 elections.  Found Gross | 2261.359
Irregularities in the Implementation of the Rs. | 2263.839
50000 Crore Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt | 2267.8
Relief Schemes. The CAG | 2270.839
report said that around Rs. 164 crore | 2275.0
was waved off | 2278.0
in the implementation. | 2281.24
Congress is the one making all the noise on 22nd. | 2284.839
Lapses and errors found in 8.5 of the cases | 2290.319
Farmers out of account Audited and not | 2293.64
eligible to get loan Perhaps brother-in-law and daughter came, | 2298.92
hence loans were given as per their wish Some of the | 2303.0
measuring criteria were not followed Some of the | 2308.359
eligible beneficiaries of the test checked | 2311.839
accounts were not  Issued Debt Waiver | 2314.8
Certificate, I believe that this is a cruel | 2320.28
step sir, in which if the bank does | 2323.64
not give the certificate, the farmer cannot take the loan again, but | 2327.72
in 34 of the eligible cases, | 2331.359
even that certificate was not given to his loan | 2334.319
waiver on which he won in 2009. | 2338.599
Today we were crying | 2343.32
[praise] for the farmer, | 2347.04
Sir, 15 rebel | 2353.079
members | 2354.64
spoke on the issue of employment, Sir, | 2356.72
Kumari Selja, Abhishek Banerjee, Sagata | 2362.119
Rai, Hibi Dun, Rajiv Rai, Dur P Yadav, | 2367.88
Dimple Yadav, GN, Prem Chandran,  And | 2370.92
K Subra ji, many such doctors | 2374.4
talked about Sumati on employment, I | 2377.92
want to clarify one topic of them, | 2381.72
Sir, our policy is to make youth. In this budget, we have brought | 2385.359
a big PM's youth package of five such schemes for the youth.  In | 2389.119
which there is | 2391.8
employment, there is skill training, there | 2394.04
is also internship, our policy is to make | 2397.44
youth capable, independent and capable, | 2402.0
that is why to make them content independent and | 2405.44
capable, a lot of schemes have been brought in other than the | 2408.24
five schemes put in PM | 2410.56
package 48 crores.  Mudra Loss Worth Rs 29 Lakh | 2415.92
Crores Have Been Dispersed Since 2014 29 Lakh | 2420.599
Crores Has Been Dispersed In Mudra That's Why | 2423.96
This Time Because It Has Been Successful We Are | 2427.68
Increasing The Amount To Rs 20 Lakhs From Rs 10 To Rs | 2431.72
20 | 2435.119
I Will Increase These Five Schemes More  I am | 2439.52
not speaking, sir, but I want to highlight | 2444.04
one topic regarding job growth in the UPA era. | 2448.24
Sir, RBI's | 2451.44
claims data which | 2456.24
gives us the periodic picture on the economy, | 2461.56
employment in the UPA era means in 2012 to | 2465.48
13.  And he mentions that the total employment has actually declined in the years 13 to 14. He does | 2481.44
not discuss about the RBI report during his tenure when the number of total employment has declined. I am raising today | 2484.88
in this House that during that time  Why did employment go | 2487.64
down? Why did it come down? If you are claiming | 2490.52
that your economy management was very good. How did | 2493.2
total employment figure come down | 2495.8
and this is RBI data not my second one. | 2499.839
Formal employment was bad hit. Total | 2504.04
persons engaged during the UPA time annual | 2508.24
survey.  of Industries says | 2511.44
that Covid pandemic has declined more than the time of our government. | 2515.96
Total person engagement declined during that time. This is | 2520.0
a data about | 2524.24
20121 Employment Totally Total Person Engaged | 2528.04
declined during that time. | 2530.48
Sir, we want to highlight the fact. Annual | 2534.04
Periodic Labor Force Survey  Report Shows | 2537.2
That The Labor Market Indicators For Persons | 2540.119
In The Age Group Of 15 Years And Now Has | 2543.24
Stelly Improved Under Prime Minister | 2545.28
Modi 2017 To | 2548.24
20222 Are Employment Figures Have Improved | 2552.559
I Am Giving You Attest Four Indicators | 2554.92
For | 2556.2
That Labor Force Participation Has Increased | 2560.319
From 49.8 In | 2567.4
Labor force participation number is 20171 to 57.5 in 2223. | 2572.079
Labor force participation has increased from | 2575.44
20 to 23 in 20171 which was 23 | 2580.359
in 20171. Women's participation has also | 2583.48
increased in youth. Sorry, the unemployment | 2587.68
rate has declined from 6 in | 2591.119
20171.  To a low of 3.2 in | 2595.76
2223 Youth unpolluted for the age group 15 to 29 has | 2600.16
declined sharply from 177.8 in | 2605.04
20171 to 10 in | 2608.0
222 So the last point on this employment | 2611.48
debate sir SBI Research Report which was | 2614.64
released in July 2024 said India | 2618.16
CreatedDocumentsFragment | 2637.96
Crore in our 10 years sir so stop | 2640.88
spreading misconceptions on employment | 2645.76
because the data is against it | 2650.03
[appreciation] | 2654.47
[music] | 2657.76
sir is the next queen of election management | 2663.77
[appreciation] | 2668.44
periodic labor force is not included | 2671.68

Kya Sir Inflation | 2700.92
Sir Inflation As A | 2703.8
Subject Sen Narel Members Spoke About It I Am | 2706.8
Not Taking Their Names Sir We Saw Double | 2711.119
Digit High Inflation Period During The | 2713.88
UPA Era And That Is Because Of Their Recital | 2717.319
Policies  I want to | 2722.76
differentiate if at all with in the range which | 2725.319
prevails now some month which have gun up there | 2727.88
is a difference domestic inflation used | 2731.52
to be higher than the global average during | 2734.079
UPS time global financial crisis | 2737.2
2008 sir if you are talking about covid which | 2740.24
is  Much Much More Complexity The Global | 2743.76
Financial Crisis Global Financial | 2746.96
Crisis 2008 UPA Government Took | 2750.68
Stimulus Measures to Boost the Economy But I'm | 2755.839
Sorry to Say I'll Come to This Particular | 2758.319
Matter Because Its Respect to One of the Rebel | 2762.079
Members Harvard and Oxford Educated | 2767.359
Leaders UPA Government Was  Run by them | 2770.44
for the | 2771.319
economy does not know when and how to overcome the | 2776.24
problem leading to high double digit inflation | 2780.359
between 2009 and 1 high fiscal deficit and | 2784.88
debt crowding out private | 2787.52
investment so between January 2012 and | 2791.64
2014 just 22 | 2795.16
months out of the total 28 months 22  Months the | 2800.16
inflation was now | 2803.079
at 9 almost double digit and almost double of | 2806.8
the four barrens limit to the permitted inflation. | 2814.88
Sir, it is | 2817.76
not easy to beat that, that is why I am talking about UPA | 2824.72

don't come from Hindi area, still I | 2880.599
remember this, Congress.  I brought inflation, this is his | 2887.119
record sir because of economy or really I have stated because of | 2893.119
illusion I want to | 2895.52
quote I want to quote the RBI | 2900.44
Governor, I am not taking his name because he | 2903.28
is not a member here but he has written a book | 2907.72
in that book.  He says, I quote the | 2911.52
Finance | 2912.96
Minister, the Finance Ministry, sorry, the | 2916.24
Finance Ministry is using it to pressure the | 2919.4
RBI to raise interest rates and | 2922.559
present Russia's picture of growth to shore | 2926.04
up sentiments because your economic | 2928.76
system had deteriorated so much that you are | 2932.76
calling the RBI and telling them.  That please | 2935.2
manage properly brother because the sentiment | 2937.4
will be affected, you did not do any management | 2939.88
but in this book the former RBI | 2943.44

on the management of the economy. He asks us | 2949.559

want to say this with sadness, when the Prime Minister | 3016.319
reduced the price of petrol and diesel twice, | 3020.319
BJP states reduced the inflation, | 3024.599
but in his state, no one did anything, | 3029.2
because of that, the inflation in the country remained high in his state.  It | 3032.68
is a harmful policy for the UPA. | 3036.079
How do we manage | 3047.0
inflation sir? | 3050.44
How is the NDA government managing it? By | 3053.64
monitoring the inflation through the Group of Ministers, | 3056.68
every step of the supply side is taken every time. | 3060.2
I give the example sir, Bharat | 3064.28
Brand Atta Rice.  And on the subject of Pulses, we are | 3068.839
purchasing and delivering it to the public with subsidy, | 3072.44
Bharat Flour | 3076.28
at 27.50 a kg and whether people are buying it or | 3080.76
not, they are absolutely buying | 3083.599
14.8 lakh tonnes of beans sold for the common public | 3088.599
Bharat Rice at | 3091.119
27.5 a kg, Rice at 27.50 a kg  Another 13.9 | 3096.72
lakh tonnes have been sold. Sir, people | 3100.24
are buying Bharat Chana Dal, 1 kg pack at 0 kg. | 3107.079
11.52 lakh tonnes have been sold. Bharat Moong Dal, | 3111.64
Both Moong Dal and Sabat Moong Dal, 2000 | 3118.0
8437 tonnes have been sold. | 3123.0
Our Bharat brand flour is reaching the common citizens, | 3126.88
that is why they are able to face the inflation. | 3131.68
Sir, I am coming to the next main topic, | 3135.76
SC is ignoring ST, the | 3139.04
government is ignoring women and poor. | 3142.16
Four people talked in this.  Charanjit C Charanjit | 3147.319
Charanjit C Shani Smt MP Yadav K | 3153.2
Radhakrishnan and Tol Rama Lavan All Members | 3156.88
Narbal Members of Parliament Who Have Raised | 3159.04
This Issue I Want to Say SC and ST and | 3162.72
Voman's | 3163.88
Location Has Gone Up | 3167.0
Substantially I am Giving the Number Sir 2324 in | 3172.52
159 1448  SC's amount this year was Rs | 3180.48
16543 crore, Rs | 3184.0
6345 crore and SC's was Rs | 3191.44
1176 crore, Rs | 3195.68
99 crore, now Rs | 3199.4
51 crore | 3200.92
more and | 3205.44
SC Rs 2,38220 | 3208.76
crore, last year this year Rs | 3215.16
3278 | 3216.72
crore and | 3219.76
8838 crore more have been given in this year. Sir, | 3225.079
tell me a little about this subject.  Bal | 3230.68
Speaker is carefully placing the topic in front of you. | 3235.44
Allocation for SC/ST has reduced. | 3240.359
I want to ask the one asking such questions. | 3243.839
Congress Government of Karnataka has | 3258.28
taken out Rs. 4301 crore from Tribal Sub Plan from the budget of Rs. 9980 given in the budget for SC/ST.  It has gone, it is | 3263.319
not known where it has gone, | 3267.799
so far | 3268.64
so far. Of the total Karnataka Government has spent | 3274.76
2228 crores including | 3278.319
1587 crores from the SC ST sub plan | 3282.72
and | 3283.799
641 crores from the Tribal sub plan | 3287.119
specifically God knows where this is going because this has | 3290.559
been a question.  In Karnataka it is | 3293.559
self by the leader of the opposition and the me India I want | 3296.359
to ask Honorable former Chief | 3299.44
Minister Charanjit Channi ji talk to your leader | 3303.359
go to Karnataka and | 3306.16
ask questions on the situation of SC there is | 3309.24
no need to ask here Congress government there | 3312.48
So many things are happening in | 3317.2
Karnataka, then one more topic from Karnataka Sir, | 3321.559
I definitely believe that every leader in Congress who talks about SC should | 3326.88
go to Karnataka today and ask what is happening that | 3330.039
SC money is being withdrawn and | 3333.039
put in private account.  No one is aware and | 3335.359
lectures are being given here on AC. | 3341.92
Valmi Karnataka Maharishi Valmiki Schedule | 3345.64
Tribe Development Corporation Scum, Big | 3349.28
Scum Sir, | 3353.24
Sir look at the topic in this, how | 3357.24
interesting is the talk. Normally Government | 3360.24
stands up to say no, what is the allegation made? | 3362.96
You are sorry for talking like this, you are | 3366.44
standing from the side of the government, but I | 3370.4
am not taking the name, the Chief Minister is standing and | 3374.68
saying, Oh brother, that | 3378.88
is not 187 crores, it is only 89 crores, he is a | 3382.88
fool, but 87 crores but only 89.  Crore, | 3389.2
see | 3391.839
what | 3393.44
confidence this Congress has, make noises and then | 3398.2
argue, say that it is not 189, brother, it | 3402.64
is just 89. | 3405.359
Leave SC's money sir, ST's money sir, both are | 3410.839
fighting there, but here SC's are giving | 3415.4
us lectures on SC.  Above Chief | 3419.96
Minister of Punjab is asking questions about | 3426.559
Bham in the past BJP government has many | 3430.68
scams, | 3432.68
sir, over Skill India Mission, over Skill India | 3436.64
Mission, NAREL member Abhishek Banerjee, | 3441.039
like rebel members Owasi ji and Varun Chaudhary ji | 3446.48
asked questions, I want to highlight three.  NAREL | 3450.079
members Abhishek Banerjee G O YC ji and | 3453.4
Varun Choudhary ji asked the question in the last | 3456.76
decade because digital public | 3459.079
infrastructure has become | 3460.52
so necessary. | 3464.839
How what is there in Skill India Digital Hub? Their | 3467.72
concern was not successful in Skill India Mission. | 3471.2
I told them gently.  Sakthi: In the | 3474.799
last decade the employment of Indian youth has | 3478.039
increased sharply rising from 34 in | 3482.119
2014 to 51 in 24. All this because of their | 3487.44
skilling, upgrading of skilling has | 3490.72
made it possible for them to come forward | 3495.44
and this time through the budget. | 3499.48
Package of five schemes, PM will take it forward through the package of Skill for Youth and | 3502.16
Employment for Youth, | 3504.76
we | 3508.68
will work for the youth and our position Sir | 3512.96
was in 19th position in the World Skills Competition, | 3516.92
in 2017 we were ranked 11th in skilling today.  I have | 3522.24
come by | 3525.92
20 Sir, three members have spoken | 3532.319
on Poverty and Global Hunger Index | 3536.72
Poverty and Global Hunger Index Kumari | 3539.119
Shailja ji Rai Vaiko ji and Gurmat Singh ji | 3544.079
Sir I want to be first of all with humility | 3549.24
and modesty | 3550.44
Se Phal Indicator Such the Global  Hunger index | 3555.76
for India sec may not work at all im not saying because you have re | 3559.799
point but a tell | 3564.24
ya all | 3569.16
credibility i try to say it in hindi | 3573.2
so i want to say something on the credibility of this global hunger index | 3582.599
i want to raise question yes  Yes, the | 3587.48
topic I am answering through question is: | 3591.559
Sir, | 3595.599
countries like Pakistan, how are countries like Sudan getting ranking ahead of India? | 3602.319
Sir, in African nation | 3608.079
even today their per capita income is less then | 3612.559
in Pakistan till date.  Why I am not saying it in | 3616.92
sense or look atom traveling No one wants to | 3620.92
travel but it is the reality that it provides | 3626.64
basic food to 8 crore people | 3631.079
in India. We are giving free food grains to 8 crore people in India, yet we are high | 3634.079
in the hunger index. | 3635.319
This will prove the credibility | 3643.16
Sir Household Savings | 3650.68
Household Savings Year Low Household Data | 3656.72
ICR Mr. Narel MP Abhishek Banerjee | 3660.559
asked this question Sir Mr. Wise Amlesh This is very | 3665.2
interesting data Sir I request worthy | 3667.52
members to kindly pay attention to this | 3669.96
fact Net Financial Savings of the  The | 3672.799
household sector from 8.32 lakh crores in | 3678.359
20131 has risen to | 3680.839
14.6 166 lakh crores in 2223. Net financial | 3686.0
savings of the household sector this is an | 3689.0
increase of 70 per household savings in the | 3692.92
form of physical assets. | 3695.96
Keeping cash in fixed deposit in the bank is one thing but | 3698.839
Buying a house or | 3702.039
making room for extension is a different matter. Today in the | 3705.039
form of physical assets | 3707.16
construction of houses and other immovable | 3710.68
properties increased from 14 lakh crores in | 3714.279
20131 | 3716.0
to 35 lakh crores in | 3720.16
2013. It clearly indicates a shift of | 3724.2
savings.  In the form of physical assets more than | 3727.92
in the form of financial assets the | 3731.359
registered investor base at the National Stock | 3734.88
Exchange has tripled from March 2020 to | 3739.16
2024 to 99.2% of Indians as of 31 March | 3744.799
2024 | 3746.799
so potentially translating into 20% of | 3751.559
India's households now are channeling  De | 3755.119
Household Savings Into Financial | 3757.72
Markets This is what we should keep in mind | 3767.88
Sir I am a very poor and | 3774.839
less able speaker Sir I am almost coming to | 3777.799
the end Sir but one and two important points | 3781.839
Sir I thought you wanted the answers Sir I thought you | 3785.48
wanted the answers Sir Lack | 3791.4
Lack of transparency in budget was the | 3794.64
issue raised by rebel member NK Prem | 3796.88
Chandran I want to highlight the fact sir in | 3800.559
fact it is completely the opposite of what was used | 3804.92
to prevail under UPA and I will give you | 3807.599
examples with chach i  Want to say this | 3810.839
charge Lack of transparency in budget should | 3814.079
actually be posted by NK Prem Chandran | 3816.68
ji to UPA Budget | 3820.839
Sir All the details have already been | 3823.319
provided I am not going to say what I renew how | 3825.0
much I revenue receipt how much I | 3827.2
receive  Borrows are meant for | 3831.16
financing fiscal deficit because | 3836.24
the question also said how government will | 3838.64
finance the additional allocation of around 56000 | 3842.799
crores so I want to just highlight Borrows are meant | 3846.4
for financing fiscal deficit | 3849.319
in a way I'd like to mention that the | 3851.52
wrong has been  Reduced dues to better | 3854.359
fiscal management and reduce the fiscal | 3857.279
deficit from 5.1 in interim budget to 4.9 | 3862.319
in the regular budget of 2425 Explains that is the | 3866.24
hall mark of Prime Minister Modi | 3868.76
from the days he was Chief Minister of | 3871.119
Gujarat Hi fiscal prudence without | 3874.2
compromising on welfare  Let us continue | 3877.4
on that we should not compromise on | 3880.4
welfare businesses and schemes but very clearly do this carefully and that we have | 3887.44
the fiscal prudence reflecting | 3889.44
in the fiscal deficit as | 3890.88
this is a total contrast to what we had achieved during | 3894.599
UP I want to  Highlights | 3897.799
How the Congress Led UPA Government's | 3901.119
Constant Practice of | 3904.52
Hydral Bangs and Insults of Oil Bunds That | 3909.279
Shifted the Fiscal Burden to Future | 3911.319
Generations Under the UPA Standard Fiscal | 3914.76
Practices Were Routinely Changed to Make the | 3918.039
Budget Numbers Look Favorable You So I Already Said | 3921.44
How the RBI Governor  Spoke In Order | 3923.96
To Make An Impression Of Nice Goody Goody You | 3927.52
Call The RBI You Fudge The Numbers You Put It | 3931.0
Under The Carpet All This Judge Happened During | 3934.039
UPA Not Our Times In Financial Year | 3938.92
2021 The Government Our Government Ander | 3941.72
Prime Minister Modi Rapidly Repeated All | 3945.44
Outstanding  National Small Savings Fund Loans which were | 3948.799
provided to the FCI in low | 3951.4
of food subsidy by providing additional budget | 3955.0
support We cleared the accounts very good | 3957.599
and as a result that came on to the budget and there was | 3960.24
no hiding the carpet external | 3962.88
boing done in the budget  I will not show the | 3965.64
budget fiscal deficit, I will show a good number, | 3968.359
but do not keep showing it here. Everything that | 3973.039
you get, everything that happens in the Finance | 3975.44
Ministry is now in the budget for all of us to see, | 3978.24
someone in it, show it from the back, put it there, keep it there, it does | 3982.079
not have to be shown here, it does not happen.  So, | 3985.88
if there is lack of transparency, it | 3988.96
happened during the UPA government. | 3991.96
Food subsidy is not yet complete. PM's | 3995.559
Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana is being | 3998.68
provided transparently through government | 4000.76
budget. Sir, from | 4003.4
2122 off budget funded schemes are being | 4006.92
proactively disclosed in the budget | 4009.24
document.  That's why we are taking every step | 4012.64
towards transparency I want this to be | 4016.599
ruled by the rebel member so the last two | 4019.839
members who ask specific questions on the | 4023.079
minority budget have been | 4025.839
reduced noble member Zia Rehman | 4030.16

approaches his assignments even with  That as a means even | 4077.88
with that seniority in age so I want | 4081.92
to respect the grandson who has now come in | 4085.0
his position I ask this question sir | 4088.319
minority budget has it come down no this judgment has come | 4091.96

very serious | 4874.76

for the country to have big economic and | 4882.08
strategic power but if there will be | 4886.04
instability and anarchy in the country the | 4890.76
journey towards developed India will become more difficult | 4894.44

Background | 5220.21
[Music] | 5222.159
Sir If Only We  Know the background of why Halwa | 5225.84
ceremonies happen. It's a very important | 5229.4
face. Were actually in this country Halwa | 5234.639
ceremonies have been happening for a | 5237.48
very long time. Honorable | 5240.84
Minister, please also tell since when is it happening. | 5245.36
When the printing press was started in Minto Road. | 5250.76
When the budget was printed there, from then onwards the | 5255.679
staff got them themselves inside | 5259.96
the prima, when they did not come out till after the budget was presented, even | 5264.719
today that system | 5270.159
is intact, those people are on their own because after going inside till they can't come | 5275.48
out.  Till the budget is red | 5279.56
on their own use to organize halwa making | 5283.159
because before starting a traditional in India it will | 5293.88
not happen in India at that time sir | 5298.84
not in Italy [ | 5299.68
music] | 5300.92
hogao kar happening in India not anywhere else | 5305.36
sir now night meaning  Nine Nights and Eight | 5310.56
Days In the old days they used to stay | 5314.0
inside only no phone no contact no land | 5317.48
line If anything one officer who was given the | 5321.6
power to come in and go out only could convey the | 5324.84
message nothing and contact with the outside world | 5329.08
now  What happened bo please | 5334.92
now sir five nights and four days now they | 5339.84
stay in the cellar of North Block and this | 5344.679
is essentially because the confidentiality of | 5347.88
budget making has to be respected so they | 5350.4
go in and before going in we start this | 5353.36
halwa ceremony and  There are media | 5356.52
reports sir one and two which a one I will | 5358.96
read out which captures it Halwa ceremony sir | 5362.76
one media report says and I read it | 5366.239
serves as a recognition for the hard work | 5368.4
and dedication of the Finance Ministry | 5370.8
officials and staff who have been diligently | 5373.52
Preparing the Budget Documents Dating | 5376.32
Back to 1980 The Halwa Ceremony Proceeds the | 5379.76
Printing of the Budget Documents Which | 5381.96
Takes Place at the Basement of the North Block | 5384.88
A Process That Must Be Completed Without | 5387.92
Any Official Leaving the Promises | 5393.04
So This Is Done More Uncut Now Again | 5397.04
Take One Line creates a sense of solid and teamwork | 5400.52
among the team members | 5404.44
It also says it stands as a testament to | 5407.4
the traditionally observed in one of the | 5411.32
most significant events in the Indian | 5413.56
governance calendar | 5416.56
Sir Yes in this in  This Se The Staff | 5422.36
Themselves The Suff | 5425.119
Make Halwa | 5426.88
Sms Sir We Dt Bm Sir I Winrell Mein S B De | 5434.4
Re St Samath Coming Too Nd This Became | 5437.639
A Photo Event Nd This Became | 5443.44
A Photo | 5444.679
Event Sir I Want To | 5448.48
Underline Ina | 5455.0
2013  In 2013, the minister started going down to the cellar and | 5460.28
distributing halwa. | 5467.08
I am asking then, byte time, because he is a | 5473.08
leader of occupation, byte time or a fully active | 5477.119
leader. Before that, the ordinance was also torn, he | 5482.0
showed independence, why did the leader of the opposition do that?  At that | 5486.119
time the Finance Minister was | 5490.52
not asked how much SC is brother, you are | 5493.679
going down for the photo, otherwise I | 5496.719
will cancel it in Halwa, because at that time | 5499.28
he was powerful, there was no remote control, nor that | 5503.28
Halwa, why was his Halwa not cancelled?  When it was | 5505.96
not cancelled, then this question was not asked. | 5509.04
Sir, India's halwa is being distributed. If anyone has this habit, then | 5514.239
that era is gone. After eating the cream, people | 5518.84
left this country or left the Parliament. | 5522.36
People went by voting and | 5526.719
showed the way to the one who ate the cream, go away, you are in power.  That | 5530.119
time is gone but at that time the | 5535.199
Finance Minister of that time was not asked that | 5537.96
you are going down to distribute | 5540.0
halwa, how many SCs are there with you, | 5542.28
how many STs are there, how many OBCs are there, that was | 5545.08
not asked at that time.  The statistics of the officers of that time were | 5548.199
not calculated but are being | 5552.28
asked now, that is why I am saying that this question is being asked with | 5555.119
some conspiracy to divide the people in this country. | 5561.239
Sir, it is a shame. | 5567.199
I am on this occasion.  But I | 5571.639
want to respect two people, | 5574.639
Sir, you do not permit them, they are | 5577.639
not even members to take their names, but printing are | 5580.639
important staff of our Finance Ministry, | 5583.199
two people, I want to mention them, | 5585.56
Sir, this is not sec, please listen to the | 5589.8
secret halwa.  It will be understandable that there is so much emotion | 5593.8
attached to it. Sir, retired | 5598.199
officer, late retired officer. His father had | 5602.28
passed away when he reached inside and there | 5606.639
is no possibility of coming out. Mr. | 5609.639
Kuldeep Sharma ji was the deputy manager of the press. | 5612.199
His father passed away. | 5616.0
He came up with the issue after being inside, yet sir, | 5620.119
look at that commitment, he did | 5623.96
not come out till the finance budget was declared, I | 5627.239
bow down to his head and bow down to him, such are the people, sir, | 5631.4
their sentiment is to create and divide, to | 5635.56
show them down.  It is not good to | 5639.92
show below, it is not good | 5642.32
second sir second I am speaking Mr. | 5647.199
Subhash Mr. Subhash is still | 5650.88
in the printing press and that too at the time of going inside he | 5655.719
got a message that his son has passed away sir | 5660.56
but he did not say it is my responsibility because the | 5664.44
halwa ceremony.  It is done, I am coming inside, I will | 5666.84
not come out from this, this is the sentiment, | 5670.119
making halwa there and going inside, performing all the duties | 5674.56
and coming out, showing it down is not right | 5680.35
[Music] | 5683.6
S Sir, above SC, above OBC, many | 5690.32
subjects, our MP.  Gun is talking | 5692.639
First Prime Minister ji read Nehru ji's | 5696.48
article to everyone, maybe Anurag ji read it, | 5700.159
tell me Nehru ji wrote on 27th June 1961, I | 5705.719
quote sir, I dislike any kind | 5711.719
of | 5713.32
reservation, more specifically in service, I | 5717.44
react strongly against anything.  Which | 5720.119
leads to inefficiency and second red | 5722.84
standards | 5724.36
Unquote Sir that is Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru the | 5727.4
first Prime Minister of India OK | 5730.28
Next Sir Kaka Kalekar Commission report | 5734.84
When the recommendation came in 1955, | 5739.76
every government of the Congress party since then has | 5742.96
sidelined it.  Backward Commission had | 5746.8
no idea in 1980. Mandal Commission | 5750.76
report was submitted to Smt. Indira | 5752.76
Gandhi, the then Prime Minister. Even she does | 5756.199
n't touch | 5759.36
it. In the slogan of the then Congress, I am speaking | 5763.04
Sir, my Hindi is not very good but I still | 5765.44
say it.  Was the | 5769.4
slogan, 'Na caste par na paat pa sakta' (I | 5773.719
will put a stamp on my hand, caste is not there, it is | 5779.96
not burst, but now it is being said, | 5784.88
caste, caste, how many people were in the halwa, how many | 5788.56
people were in the halwa photo, how many were at the bottom, when | 5792.4
then, if you got it right)  Had you brought it only then, there was a chance for the OBC | 5797.48
officer to reach the secretary level today. | 5803.56
Stop sir, no, sir, perhaps Anurag ji did | 5810.28
not tell me. I want to read another quotation, | 5812.48
Sir | 5814.159
Rajiv Gandhi ji. Late Prime Minister Rajiv | 5818.239
Gandhi ji gave an interview to him.  Alok Mehta | 5822.199
in March 1985 Senior Journalist in that | 5826.88
interview I am quoting from former Prime Minister about | 5830.119
OBC reservation | 5832.44
Sir no promotion of | 5836.52
idiots in the name of | 5841.199
survey and and that | 5844.04
promoting idiots in the name of | 5847.76
reservation and that promoting idiots in the | 5851.04
name of reservation | 5861.08
Sir Ambedkar ji is giving so many lectures on the issue of 'uncoat or conflict' which harms the entire country. Sir, after coming out of the cabinet, he said, 'I don't want to | 5866.56
be in this because of his | 5869.0
innocent justice for backward community and | 5872.04
for his letters, all these subjects are there.  It is a long | 5876.52
letter sir but the relevant paragraph | 5879.159
read so quote I will now refer to another | 5885.08
second in this bucket | 5888.04
matter but I will now refer | 5890.88
to another matter has made | 5895.32
me dissatisfied with the government it | 5898.719
relates to the treatment given to the backward | 5902.76
classes  A Schedule Caste I Was Very Sorry | 5907.36
That The Constitution Did Not Embody Any | 5910.88
Safeguards For The Backward Classes It Was | 5914.8
Left To Be Done By The Executive | 5916.679
Government On The Basis Of Recommended | 5921.52
By The President More Than A Year Lapses Since | 5926.96
We Passed The Constitution But The  The Government has | 5930.119
not even thought of the point of the Commission. | 5934.679
So, except Ambedkar ji government, | 5939.4
whose government was Saras, Sir, the first government under | 5943.199
Pandit Jalal Nehru, the first Prime Minister, the | 5947.239
statements of his grandfather and great grandfather, these are all the things, today we are | 5954.159
talking about reservation and SC/ST.  Let's | 5957.639
do I want to ask a question Sir | 5961.44
now | 5963.92
speak in English | 5970.56
Sir speak in English Charity Bug Fum | 5976.0
Home Listen Listen Charity Begin Fum Home Meaning | 5982.88
Whatever you are saying to others and you do it first | 5987.52
I am asking Sir Rajiv Gandhi | 5992.08
How many SCs are there in the foundation? How many | 5994.599
SCs are there? How many OBCs are there? Because the | 6000.32
names of people from outside are not to be read. There are | 6003.639
nine people. There is no AC. | 6009.56
Charity begins at home. Sir, first | 6014.719
correct your arrangements, give it to the SCs, then come and | 6018.52
ask us, brother. Tell me this.  Sir, then let me | 6022.199
give you another example, Sir Rajiv Gandhi Charitable | 6026.199
Trust, there are five people in it, I am | 6030.08
not reading the names in the Board of Trustees, but I did not see even a single | 6033.679
SC | 6034.72
[appreciation], | 6041.4
so Sir, we | 6046.92
intend to do good for SC and ST people.  You can keep it, | 6053.679
Grandfather and Grandfather, everyone's statements are the same on Generation After, | 6057.8
when everything is the same and no work has been done, if | 6061.159
you go and say today, then how will you | 6065.239
get confidence sir and on top of that, it is an emotional | 6069.639
sentimental matter like pudding in which the entire | 6073.639
Finance Ministry staff of that mint is locked inside.  You | 6076.88
stay in the room and | 6079.88
work to sweeten their mouths, when you are like this | 6086.36
