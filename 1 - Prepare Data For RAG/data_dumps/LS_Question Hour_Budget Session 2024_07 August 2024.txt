Park in the particular | 206.319
region and as of now the built up area of | 210.68
that technology park is 10000 square feet | 213.959
but the policy of setting up technology | 216.76
parks is such that the State Government does | 219.599
Given acres and built up space area of | 223.28
50000 sq ft the Ministry of | 225.959
Electronics and IT is prepared to | 228.72

operational  And using the incubation they are also | 240.68
one company which export this | 243.319
software technology park and so many | 246.799
questions re about IT | 249.239
Hub The Government of India does not | 253.079
specifically have any policy for IT Hub | 257.239
but State Government is some IT City | 260.68
Hitech City they give infrastructure | 264.24

about 100 crore mobile users.  And | 288.039
about 70 crore internet users in this | 290.4
country which is a very phenomenon and in times to come | 294.12
the dominance of any country will be judged | 297.199
by space in the cyber space and India is | 299.88
very well placed for that we have come along with | 303.28
various initiatives and schemes.  I Can | 306.36
Tell That Electronics Manufacturing | 308.759
Hubs Are Being Set Up Under The Electronics | 311.52
Manufacturing Hubs It's A 200 Acre Land | 315.0
If It's Available A Matching Grant In The | 317.4
Central Government Will Be Done What Ever | 319.199

Other Schemes As Well Which I Would  Like | 324.52
to bring to the notice of the Member and the | 327.72
House that the Government of India is | 332.039
championing We have this Next Generation | 335.44
Incubation Scheme for Startups We have the | 339.6
Technology Incubation and Development | 341.36
Center under tight scheme We have another scheme | 345.36
Samrit Ver we have Grant of 40  For lakhs of | 348.919
start ups to accelerate their already | 351.24
started work we have Genesis scheme | 355.319
out of Rs 490 crore and do other initiatives | 359.6
the rural areas especially the tier two and tier | 362.0
th cities that is where the focus is now as | 365.639
the IT sector is more and | 367.8
Less concentrated in seven | 371.4
metros we in the government plan to take | 374.759
this initiative to the tier two and tier three | 377.8
cities and I can tell | 380.039
you STPI parks are 65 in number out | 384.52
of that 57 on tier two and tier three cities | 387.919
and we try to take  It is very | 392.199
congested IT hub like Bangalore, | 395.8
Hyderabad and other cities and I can see that more | 400.84
initiative will be taken for | 404.28
rural India and the connectivity and | 406.639
setting up it is only a member supplementary | 414.36
so my concern is similar to the smart city | 418.12
program I  Would like Minister and the | 420.759
Department to have visionary initiative to | 422.96
attract company and generate employment as | 426.12

as if IT industry goes a | 449.84
revenue of about 21.3 lakh crores and out of | 453.4
which 16.7 lakh crores is export | 457.4
oriented so we  Can see that the employment | 460.84
also that is generated by this is about 54 | 463.479
lakh people out of which the members will be | 466.52
especially happy that at 36 there are women | 469.36
employees so there is a big sector and | 473.12
initiative for the women employment as well | 475.72
and we plan to  I have said before taking | 479.84
various initiatives to take the IT industry | 483.0
to tier two and tier three cities of our | 485.639
country and ensure that every citizen of | 489.199
India gets the benefit of the IT | 491.199

Mr. Gurjit | 512.479
Ojla thank you Speaker Sir Speaker Sir I have a | 515.719
request to the Honorable Minister. | 518.56
Software Technology Park in Amritsar will be ready in 2022 | 521.0
after a lot of hard work. | 523.519
Amritsar is very close to a Central Asian country. It is a | 526.44
two-three hour flight away. Along with the Central | 529.0
Asian countries, they also need | 531.56
software, so Amritsar is | 534.32
for software export.  If it can become a good hub, then | 537.64
I can also make a living. You said that | 540.6
as the cities have become busy, all are more | 543.279
busy, so you should make Amritsar the top one. If | 545.64
Amritsar can become Big IT, then will the | 549.04
Minister make it functional? | 551.64
Can you give a date as soon as possible for | 553.92
Amritsar Software Technology Park of | 556.6
Information Technology? Thank you Honorable | 559.04
Speaker, the question asked by the Honorable MP is | 562.36
definitely on the special priorities of the Amritsar government, | 565.839
our | 569.959
exports are happening there but IT | 572.64
As far as the question is concerned, which is a scheme of the Government of India to | 577.48
open Software Technology Parks, I have already said that from time to time, | 581.24
65 have been opened out of which 57 are | 585.36
in Tier II and Tier TH cities and its | 588.0
provision is that if  The state government should be | 593.0
ready to give two acres of land. | 600.8
Honorable Speaker, STPI of Amritsar has been | 603.839
completed and its functions will | 606.519

today the country's success in renewable energy.  Q. | 635.48
Under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the world's most popular leader, respected Modi ji, renewable energy is | 638.68
playing a major role in the world. It was | 645.32
started in Gujarat itself when he was the Chief Minister. He started the | 648.8
Charan Solar Park in Gujarat on about 4900 acres of | 654.2
solar energy.  While inaugurating this park, the | 657.48
largest solar energy | 661.639
park in the entire A was started by him while being the Chief Minister, | 664.8
today | 669.399
after assuming the role of the Prime Minister, whether it is | 673.04
talking about carbon emissions in the world, | 678.279
talking about climate change in G20 or COP 26.  Be | 682.0
it in the summit or in | 686.04
forming an alliance for solar energy by joining together 120 countries, | 689.88
Respected Modi ji has | 692.839
played a major role in the world. In the coming time, | 696.279
we have set a target of around 500 giga watts in 2030. | 701.399
More to come.  At a | 704.519
time when we are working towards the target of zero carbon emissions by 2070, | 708.68
I | 711.519
would like to know from the Honorable Minister that | 717.639
what plan has our government made for this important ambition, what | 719.959
strategy has it made and what steps are we going to take, | 726.16
sir?  I would like to thank the honorable member for | 731.24
an important | 733.72
question that he has raised here today. As | 738.44
he has said, one, I accept | 741.639
that since the time when the Honorable Prime Minister | 745.88
was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, | 750.76
Gujarat is the leader in this and is the number one fastest | 754.8
country.  E Concern A for renewable | 757.04
energy | 758.72
concern | 760.44
But after becoming the Prime Minister of the country, | 763.68
under the leadership of Modi ji, renewable energy is | 767.16
our priority. Overall energy sector is our priority. Among the | 769.959
nine priorities, energy sector is our | 772.56
priority. S for S Renewable | 776.639
energy | 779.959
from concern. Total after the leadership of Modi ji.  There has been an | 786.76
increase of 165 in renewable energy from | 791.12
7638 GW in | 793.6
2014 today it has | 798.04
become 203 20.1 giga watt so to achieve the target | 804.92
we have now like I told in solar | 809.44
in 10 years there was only 2.82 giga watt solar energy in 2014 | 815.24
Today there is | 819.199
8547 solar energy capacity, so to move ahead, | 826.079
under the Prime Minister of | 829.36
Leadership, several reforms have been unleashed in this | 833.56
sector today and have achieved more than 200 GW | 836.48

Sir Shri Janardan Singh Singri | 1052.6
Wal Chairman Sir, India is working towards environment protection and | 1056.64
climate change in achieving the target under the | 1059.88
leadership of Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  It is | 1061.76
continuously | 1064.08
known through newspapers | 1067.0
that a continuous increase is being recorded in the non-biobased energy capacity in renewable energy sources. | 1072.44
This | 1074.96
is very good for the country from the perspective of energy. Sir, I want to | 1077.48
know through you from the honorable mantra.  I | 1079.559
want, is the government considering setting up | 1086.159
fossil based power scheme in Bihar especially in other parts of the state including Maharajganj parliamentary constituency | 1089.32
and | 1091.64
how many efforts have been made for this till now and | 1094.36
how much money has been allocated to Bihar for this. | 1100.6
Sir, as far as Bihar is concerned.  And | 1104.48
suction around 1600 ect pump under component | 1109.52
C for the feeder level solarization | 1112.96
and RP Rebel Energy Purchase Obligation, we have made | 1116.919
mandatory, Bihar's achievement in it is | 1120.36
66 | 1123.48
and | 1126.44
total small hydro has | 1130.679
a potential of 5.26 p8 MW in the state, out of | 1136.919
which 70 7 MW has been installed.  Hai | 1141.44
Mr. Fernandes | 1147.0
Sir in 2000 and Sustainable Goal set by the | 1152.24
United Nations when review happened we fell | 1156.2
short of these goals in 215 Sir 17 other | 1161.32
Sustainable Development Goals or set up in | 1163.84
which one was focus on alternative energy and | 1167.6
renewable energy | 1169.559
so since  The Target 2030 is the mechanism | 1173.799
to ensure that the goal that has been set we will be able | 1177.52
to match because we are importing more coal. | 1185.6
I can also answer against the policy of the Sustainable Goal Sir Coal | 1189.679
but in today's  I am not handling coal | 1191.76
but I want to say this. | 1196.12
I want to say that | 1198.919
as | 1199.84
far as coal is concerned, coal | 1204.0
production has doubled under the leadership of Modi ji. | 1207.36
Sir, but I do not want to go into that | 1212.08
because today is the renewal date.  As far as energy is concerned, the | 1215.4
work we are doing in renewable energy, I have already explained it, | 1223.4
still I and once | 1228.919
from 2000 4 to 14, its total expenditure was | 1232.72
691 crores in renewable energy. Sir, this | 1237.96
ministry was established in 1992 but | 1241.679
Expenditure happened in the last 10 years when the world was | 1244.96
started and the world was progressing, | 1247.0
ours was only Rs 6000 crores, till today | 1250.76
our budget for this year alone is Rs 21000 crores | 1254.799
sir and | 1256.96
the total we have spent till date is Rs 3652 crores during the period of Modi ji. | 1263.52
Sir, more than that, it has | 1268.0
increased to 500. Sir, out of the overall | 1271.84
target of NDC, the | 1276.159
emissions target of the GDP is 33, in that also | 1281.52
we are no more than today till 2021, | 1289.799
we are moving ahead as per the target of that target.  Investments are being made accordingly | 1291.799
and I have already mentioned the scheme that has been implemented | 1294.48
and along with that, to | 1298.36
achieve this, | 1300.799
PM Kusum, PM Surya Ghar and | 1305.48
VGF for offshore, including green hydrogen and | 1308.0
VGF for high efficiency models.  After getting all this, | 1310.76
today our | 1314.559
overall scheme of Rs 160000 crore is our scheme | 1319.679
Mr. Amra Ram | 1323.12
Choudhary Honorable Chairman Sir, I | 1326.88
would like to know from the Minister through you that | 1328.96
how much capacity has been installed in Rajasthan in solar energy | 1331.4
and how much | 1334.64
is still in the pipeline and the power  Big lines of grade | 1339.36
which are being laid in Rajasthan. | 1349.44
What compensation per span has Power Grade made to the farmers whose fields the 766 KV line is passing through? | 1354.08
Sir, it is a pain to tell us that this is the work of renewable energy.  We | 1358.36
work sir and it is more and more that we | 1361.48
set up a power project, we | 1368.64
set up a power plant of renewable energy, the state plays a role in it, | 1372.679
apart from this we also have a state of | 1376.84
share of renewable energy, the | 1379.36
total electricity installed is 66%. | 1383.64
Share of Nabal Energy is 60 at 66, | 1389.24
renewable energy in it is | 1395.88
2817 giga watt, | 1401.559
Sir Sir, as | 1404.52
far as projects are set up, private people do so | 1407.559
and private people buy them and | 1411.96
if government projects are set up in it, then this work would be | 1414.52
looked after by the state government, Sanjay Jaiswal, | 1418.159
thank you very much.  Speaker Sir, first of all I | 1423.76
congratulate the government for its achievements in the renewable energy sector | 1425.559
and especially to increase the income of farmers, | 1428.24
PM Kusum's | 1431.32
plan to set up small solar power plants is a | 1434.919
very good plan, but | 1437.44
Its tender was also floated in Bihar, but it was done | 1440.4
at a specific place, like | 1442.36
in my district, Dhana Thagra, where sugarcane is | 1445.039
cultivated the most, it was made specific at that place. | 1448.2
Now was this the mistake of the bureaucracy of Bihar government | 1450.039
or where?  I do | 1452.08
n't know what was said but if | 1455.12
all the farmers of Bihar get the benefits of PM Kusum Yojana and | 1457.32
they can set up solar power plants on their unused land, | 1460.64
then can the Central Government | 1463.6
consider giving this direction to the Bihar Government | 1467.08
where it is needed? | 1470.12
Today, due to the fact that you have allotted our quota | 1473.2
to Bihar, we and | 1475.84
our farmers are not able to set up solar power plants, | 1477.76
so our farmers can set up solar power plants comfortably | 1480.64
and whatever is possible, can the | 1485.44
Honorable Minister do that?  Will you talk to Bihar government | 1488.52
sir, as far as I have already explained | 1492.08
and have suction | 1496.0

purchase obligation is also at 66 but as | 1509.6
far as Kusum Yojana, the subject in PM Kusum Yojana is | 1514.96
specific. | 1520.279
I examine the area and tell it to the member, we | 1523.88
allocate state wise, we will allocate | 1526.52
to the state A as per the demand of the state PM | 1530.159
Kusum Demand Driven Project Scheme Sir, | 1536.36
we allocate according to the state from which we get the demand.  The state | 1539.2
government decides where to install it, so it is something like this, | 1541.559
so we will look into it | 1545.36

sir I through you  I | 1572.919
would like to know from the Honorable Minister of New and Renewable Energy whether there | 1585.76
is any criteria available to determine the suitability of land for a solar energy project. Details of disposal: | 1591.08
Officially installed capacity of solar energy from year 2014 to date. Sir, | 1599.399
Role details, What is  Sir, it is | 1605.36
private, as I | 1607.6
said earlier in the answer to my question, private companies | 1612.679
set up projects and the | 1615.64
state | 1618.799
government does the role of acquisition etc. Sir, there | 1624.24
is a lot of potential in West Bengal, sir, | 1630.559
but we do not communicate with West Bengal.  We | 1633.64
try to do this but I | 1637.039
want to say with sadness because we want to set up | 1639.2
renewable energy projects in the entire country | 1642.52
where there is more potential | 1645.0
but West Bengal Government does | 1647.6
not do any communication with the Central Government. | 1650.399
Honorable | 1655.52
Member | 1657.08
My Last Supplement Sir, did the | 1661.799
Government  Areas with high potential have been identified for solar energy purposes. If the solar energy | 1670.399
related | 1674.24
issues | 1676.76
continue to occur | 1680.72
and where the potential is high, then the State | 1685.48
Government, where the project has been | 1688.6
implemented by the Government of India, the | 1693.159
scheme and the scheme.  Where to implement and | 1696.0
state government will decide only | 1697.919
Shri Ravi Kishan | 1707.12

Sumiti Thank you very much Speaker Sir Sir there | 1715.12
is an estimator Waste in India is going | 1718.039
to jump | 1720.24
to lakhs of tons by 2030 from the current 1 | 1725.12
lakh tons due to rapid development  Sorry | 1728.32
deployment of new solar capacities this | 1731.44
is quite concerning and alarming sir | 1733.84
especially given the fact that we do not have a | 1736.64
proper waste manage | 1738.6
and dispersal system for solar as heavy | 1741.96
metals in solar panels including lead and | 1745.72
cadmium can contaminate the ground water and | 1748.679
affect the plant  Life is a huge threat | 1753.12
so I'd like to ask through you the minister | 1756.039
I the government waiting for a pyramid of | 1758.12
hazardous solar waste to | 1760.44
measure what measures | 1762.6
the government proposes | 1766.799
to take in this regard | 1770.039
how to sell depot solar way thank | 1774.799

Question related to | 1779.159
the assessment of the land available and barren | 1783.48
land, still I | 1785.36
want to tell that apart from the Central Pollution Board | 1789.519
which works under the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, the Government of India has also | 1796.679
notified the Ministry of Environment and Forest Climate Change.  E Waste | 1799.44

Table of Contents Thanks Speaker Sir, the | 1858.24
government has announced in this budget that | 1861.919
We will promote farmer producer | 1865.039
organizations, cooperative societies and startups for storage of produce. | 1868.399
I come from Maharashtra | 1871.44
where FCI has godowns in which | 1875.96
many are in such a bad condition that they | 1879.76
need to be riveted. My question is that what has the | 1882.96
government given in the budget?  It was announced that by when will the | 1886.36
CI godowns in Maharashtra be | 1889.279
renovated and | 1892.36
what provisions has the government made for Maharashtra for making AC godowns | 1894.08
and at which places it will be | 1896.76
made, how much money has been allocated for this | 1899.76
and it has also announced that  Has the deadline for completion been | 1904.0
fixed? | 1910.88
Sir, as far as storage capacity is | 1915.24
concerned, the | 1921.039
total | 1923.12
own storage capacity of the FCI in our Maharashtra is 99.3 lakh | 1928.12
tonnes, | 1930.6
7.19 lakh tonnes of total own plus has been hired, 16% 42 | 1935.799
state storage capacity with the  State | 1938.12
agency is 6.98 Sir, our total is | 1941.72
23.40 LMT. As far as upgradation is | 1945.72
concerned, it is a continuous process. Sir, | 1948.88
now we have done the upgradation of the storage capacity through budget support from the Government of India for | 1951.519
quality control | 1955.88
and for IT engineering security and overall | 1960.2
upgradation. | 1968.88
1500 crore for upgrading it in diala plated condition etc. we have | 1972.96
given to the FCI and they will decide the | 1976.0
priority and it is on going continuous | 1979.039
process and FCI will decide and if | 1982.36
member writes to me specifically where it is in | 1985.0
Very Diala Palte Condition Wel Use The Necessary | 1987.559
Instruction To The | 1989.0
FC Nal | 1994.32
According to Member Chairman, NABARD, in our country, | 1998.0
due to post harvest loss, grains worth 18.5 billion | 2002.6
dollars are recycled. | 2006.96
In all the godowns of FCI, grains rot openly | 2010.32
or are eaten by rats.  Then FCI | 2013.279
disposes of it and we | 2016.88
can recycle it to make inal or food i.e. manual. | 2020.639
So, my question | 2023.36
is, Minister, will the government and FCI | 2027.519
make any policy in which the waste food | 2030.519
grains can be recycled? | 2034.44
Sir, like I said earlier also. | 2039.08
As the technology of processors has been upgraded, | 2041.32
we have completely adopted that technology, | 2043.76
yet today | 2045.72
we have taken the steps taken by the FCI to safeguard | 2049.399
the quality of the food grains and | 2052.24
prevent the wastage. Food grains are stored | 2054.44
by adopting a proper scientific code.  Of | 2057.2
storage practices and stored | 2060.359
scientifically built godowns, adulterated | 2064.28
material such as wooden crates, bamboo mats, | 2068.04
polythene sheets, all we are using, sir, | 2072.0
fumigation covers, nalan ropes, nets, insecticides | 2076.679
for the control of stored grain, insect | 2079.639
pest provided, Godadon aise toh bahut | 2083.96
major hai. | 2085.96
And | 2088.639
whereas earlier we used traditional | 2091.679
wheat | 2093.599
open cow covered and open storage, | 2098.24
today we have stopped all open coverage and | 2102.88
grain bags are kept plain and covered | 2105.52
without polythene cover, now the entire godown is a | 2109.76
regular constructed godown and | 2113.839
with this  Approximately 180 LMT of | 2118.72
CP has been covered and plain faced out. | 2122.48
Along with that, I also proudly say that | 2124.8
now our total wastage as per | 2129.119
rice is a concern which | 2134.359
was 39 in 2014 and today it is almost at 07. | 2139.52
Negligible transistor loss reduced from | 2143.52
35 in the year 2013 to 144 Edge of Now | 2149.96
Rice Transit lot reduced from | 2152.599
058 in | 2154.48
2013 142 Today P9 | 2160.359
is improving day by day and for this | 2164.56
also those who dispose wastage are | 2167.04
already  Policy in Existence Smt. Kala | 2171.24
Ben Mohan Bhai | 2176.68
Delkar Sudeep Thank you Speaker Sir, | 2181.48
Dadra Nagar Haveli is a tribal dominated | 2184.48
area, where the condition of the farmers is | 2188.0
very pathetic. I want to know from the Minister | 2190.64
that there is | 2192.68
not even a single store in my state parliamentary constituency from which the farmers can get help.  They have to | 2195.56
go to many places to sell their grains, | 2198.56
in which the farmers have to spend from their own pockets. The | 2201.0
total production of rice in Dadra Nagar Haveli is | 2203.92
about | 2206.079
33000 metric tons. Sir, if | 2210.24
Food Corporation of India (FCI) starts purchasing then the | 2215.0
grains of the Annadata farmer brothers here.  Will also be | 2217.839
purchased at the government MSP rate, due to which the | 2221.24
farmers will get direct benefit. I | 2223.92
want to know from the government that | 2226.119
in my state, there will be no godown by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for the storage of food grains for the government to provide alternative storage capacity and | 2229.079
purchase of food to the local farmers.  What | 2235.599
is the purpose of making it and | 2239.48
where and how much amount has been allocated for it, should it be | 2243.88
completed and what time | 2248.359
limit has been fixed so that the | 2251.52
grains can be purchased by the farmers of my state so that the farmers can | 2254.56
get direct benefits from it and the farmers do not have to | 2256.839
go somewhere else?  There is no need | 2268.24
today, | 2271.119
we Daman and Dag Haveli are fed from | 2275.2
the depot which is ours, around 1000 | 2279.839
metric tons are supplied from there, the | 2284.119
FSD mean depot is verbal, it is supplied from there | 2291.2
and I am talking about it today.  There is | 2297.319
no proposal before us today | 2302.839
Mr. Sudeep Bampa ji | 2310.24
sir my | 2311.48
question is little bit complicated | 2315.76
sdi food | 2318.359
grain capacity which is necessary for the | 2322.52
present FCI godown are not | 2327.319
sufficient but one | 2329.88
group is going to take over the food grain | 2334.04
keeping | 2335.56
the special | 2339.16
Name of the Godown | 2341.96
Silo Silo | 2344.52

Sir Ss | 2359.359
Silo Godown I expected the minister to come | 2362.68
out with the truth and tell | 2366.72
it after they have taken over | 2369.68
the market of the farmers.  Of the whole of the | 2373.72
country by installation of the silo type | 2378.24
of godown sir I have seen silo godown because I was | 2381.56
the chairman of this standing | 2384.44
committee of food the are sophisticated | 2388.079
godowns are very big from 50000 metric | 2392.24
tons to about 2 lakh metric tons of  Godau | 2396.2
Lately Updated But Such Cyclo Godowns Are | 2401.599
Mainly Going To Be Set Up In Gujarat And | 2404.119
Maharashtra Now I Want To Ask Mist | 2408.599
Weather Are You | 2410.319
In Plan Or Planning To Give The | 2415.56
Total Idea To Be Implemented By The | 2418.96
Adani Group Through The Country For Establishment Of | 2422.52
Silo Project Removing the FCI Go | 2426.28
Down Na | 2430.92
Sir, as far as storage capacity is concerned, sir, | 2437.96
we have total storage capacity, today we have | 2444.2
FCI's state, we also take it on | 2448.359
hire from State Veras Corporation, put all this together, | 2452.04
today we have passed | 2456.24
837 is 68 LMT Sir, normally we store 6 to 700 | 2461.72
LMT, hence we do | 2467.76
not have the question of shortage of storage in today's day, that will be first in your period, | 2470.44
not in our period today, but second sir | 2474.359
second sir second part of the  Question Sir, for these | 2477.88
people, | 2478.92
this is | 2486.24
trans perfect tendering. | 2489.72
In today's time, in the | 2492.56
first phase of the hub and | 2495.839
spoke model capacity of 34 P 87 LMT | 2500.64
silo at 80 location is planned to be | 2503.28
constructed out of Ch | 2505.96
10.15.  LMT capacity at 14 locations | 2509.4
under the DBF model FCI own land and at | 2513.4
24.7 LMT capacity at 66 locations under | 2517.4
DBF mode private land have been | 2520.2
awarded and this is what it is I don't know about the | 2525.599
company but that's what I want to say | 2530.48
Tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt idden on most | 2537.4

Those who are not members of this House, their | 2558.68
names should not be taken. I follow your orders | 2560.68
but those who | 2563.2
raised their names, I want to ask a question about those who are | 2566.079
sitting with the ED alliance and | 2570.559
what has been done in Telangana recently, | 2572.8
sir.  This is how the award has been given in Rajasthan by the | 2577.4
government of this party, who has allotted it just like this | 2580.4
and in Kerala, Sir, who has done this in Kerala, | 2584.04
Sir, every rule, every rule is an open | 2588.96
tender, perfect, | 2607.4
that is why such allegations are made. 25 Shri Brajmohan | 2612.64
[Praise] | 2622.599
Aggarwal Yes, Honorable Speaker Sir, | 2626.559
thank you very much Question No. 225 | 2629.64
Honorable Minister, | 2632.76
Honorable Member, Honorable Speaker Sir, | 2637.119
I want to know from the Honorable Minister that | 2639.92
in the last three years, because Chhattisgarh, | 2644.04
where 32 per cent population is tribal, the | 2648.16
population of caste has increased to 12 and 42  But it is surrounded by forests, there are | 2652.44
mountains, rivers and drains, | 2655.4
how many trains have been canceled there in the last three years | 2658.16
and also the | 2661.079
revenue received from the zone of Chhattisgarh, at | 2663.8
what level is that revenue in the country and in the | 2666.559
future, Honorable Minister.  Yes, Honorable Minister should give information about what is the plan for laying railways | 2669.48
in the remote areas of Chhattisgarh where there is no transportation facility. | 2679.44
Honorable Speaker, Chhattisgarh, as the | 2682.319
Honorable Parliament said, is a tribal dominated | 2686.079
state.  And it is a very important state. | 2689.2
Unfortunately, for a long time, | 2694.44
very less funds were given for the development of railways in Chhattisgarh. Today funds are also being given, | 2698.04
work is also being done and the issue which has been raised by the | 2700.319
Honorable MP is a very | 2702.64
important topic. | 2707.0
I would also like to clarify that a year ago, there were | 2710.52
56 | 2715.0
mail express and 121 passenger trains passing through Chhattisgarh, | 2718.72
today there are 58 mail express and 128 passenger | 2724.079
trains, but there is no need to stop only at this number, | 2728.119
Honorable Speaker, in Chhattisgarh today.  An | 2735.52
investment of about Rs 37000 crore is being made for the development of railways. There are | 2737.88
eight new projects. There are eight new line | 2742.44
projects due to which 1358 kilometers of | 2746.559
new railway line is being built in which an | 2750.04
investment of Rs 000 crore is being made. There | 2753.04
are 17 projects in Dublin.  There are projects in Dublin | 2755.119
in which a 373 kilometer new track has been laid and an | 2760.52
investment of Rs 16604 crore is being made at | 2763.92
many places, third line at many places, fourth line at many places. | 2766.599
Honorable Speaker, if we look at the position of Chhattisgarh, | 2772.599
this is the biggest corridor from Kolkata to Mumbai. | 2775.359
All the trains going through the corridor go through Chhattisgarh, | 2777.92
hence it is | 2780.16
very important to increase the capacity in Chhattisgarh and that is why the | 2787.48
investment which used to be only Rs 311 crore 10 years ago | 2789.96
for the state of Chhattisgarh is now Rs | 2796.52
6922 crore i.e. by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.  Today they are giving 22 times more | 2800.92
investment and its results are also | 2802.92
visible. Honorable Speaker ji, in | 2805.359
just one and a half kilometers in the first year, it is as | 2808.8
important as Chhattisgarh. The recognized | 2811.72
MP said that it is a tribal dominated area | 2814.76
and there are a lot of hilly areas and forest | 2817.48
areas like this.  Only 65 | 2820.64
kilometers of work was done in a year in the area, today work is being done | 2825.319
on 100 kilometers in a year i.e. 15 times more than before. | 2829.8
In one, I would | 2832.64
also like to put forward this issue to the Honorable MP through you | 2835.52
that when there is too much work in Railways | 2838.28
then  When new tracks of railways are | 2842.119
connected to the assisting network, | 2844.52
then there is definitely a problem of cancellation of trains. | 2848.319
I am sensitive towards that problem | 2850.48
and that is why a new method has also been | 2853.839
started. In the last seven-eight months, a | 2856.52
lot of practice has been done on this.  After a lot of | 2859.2
practice, we have come out with a new method so | 2861.72
that the maximum | 2863.599
work, which is called NE working, is done | 2866.16
before the non-interlock working so | 2869.079
that there is minimum interference | 2871.64
during the connection. Honorable Speaker, I | 2875.119
want to know from the Honorable Minister that | 2876.88
Bilaspur is the railway zone, that zone gives | 2880.4
what share of the income earned in the whole country | 2882.64
and as part of that, I | 2885.72
also request you one thing that | 2888.2
due to the frequent cancellation of trains there and | 2891.359
also the poor condition of the roads there.  Due to this, the | 2893.4
passengers there are facing a lot of problems, | 2895.44
so in future will you give instructions | 2897.76
that | 2900.64
trains should be canceled only when absolutely necessary and not otherwise? | 2903.119
I am aware that more than 200 | 2905.319
trains have been canceled in the last three years. | 2907.96
And it has been started again and again, | 2910.319
due to which the passengers are facing problems and | 2912.48
because of your work, I am also | 2914.24
aware that due to your work, | 2917.04
doubling is happening, for this a new | 2918.839
railway line is being built.  So, Honorable | 2921.559
Minister, what percentage of the railway zone of Bilaspur | 2926.079
contributes to the total income in the country | 2928.839
and in comparison to that, is the | 2930.799
expenditure that should be spent on railways in Chhattisgarh being | 2932.559
spent? | 2937.28
It is true | 2940.079
that 10 years ago there was no justice towards Chhattisgarh, | 2946.68
but today justice is being done, | 2950.0
today sufficient funds are being allocated and the | 2952.839
work is also increasing and as  Honorable MP | 2955.079
said that due to the speed with which the work is being done, it has | 2965.319
also caused problems in the cancellation of passenger trains in the traffic and for this I | 2968.4
am also sensitive and today we are trying to find out as | 2971.2
much as possible.  Suppose it used to | 2979.24
take four days to make a NE connection, then you | 2982.119
are trying to make it take only three days. Such | 2984.119
efforts are going on very much and the | 2987.16
work is going on as fast as the Speaker in Chhattisgarh. | 2989.2
The capacity will be created so well | 2992.24
that many of the problems which | 2995.72
were due to | 2997.24
lack of capacity will | 2999.64
also be eliminated. | 3002.52

Government and Minister is going to | 3112.64
reschedule the timing of according to | 3115.2
passengers convenience | 3117.28
Honorable Speaker Sir, there | 3121.24
is no point in doing anything wrong anywhere.  He | 3123.68
gave a very clear answer to the question of Honorable MP Sir | 3127.28
that 3 years ago, before Covid, there were 56 Mail | 3131.28
Express with 121 passengers, today there are 58 Mail | 3135.319
Express with 128 passengers, the | 3144.24
train has been canceled while working | 3147.319
and this  For this, the work done in the Railways, | 3150.72
Honorable Chairman, if the work | 3153.04
is done fast and when a new track is | 3157.04
connected to the assisting network, then the train has to be canceled, it | 3159.28
is different in the highway, | 3161.839
what happens in the highway, I agree, Chairman, that you are | 3163.88
a  Diversion is made and | 3166.559
any truck or train can go through diversion. It is | 3173.68
not possible for a train to get down from the track and get back on it. | 3177.079
In the train, you have to cancel the trains | 3178.88
whenever you add a new particular section.  If yes, then | 3182.4
this is a technical requirement. If it is | 3184.72
about Kerala, then the question of Kerala | 3188.079
can be asked separately by the Honorable MP at any time. | 3190.559
In Kerala, Honorable Speaker, I would like to tell you | 3192.799
that there is a serious problem of land acquisition | 3195.24
and I, through the Honorable MP, will appeal to | 3197.96
your state government.  I would also | 3199.92
like to request that you Honorable MP must | 3203.48
coordinate with the State Government and | 3206.799
make efforts for land acquisition. I would | 3209.799
like to clearly tell you through you | 3212.4
Honorable MP that funds for Kerala are being provided by | 3215.359
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.  There will never | 3217.44
be a dearth of Mr. | 3221.0
Chintaman | 3227.24
Maharaj. No matter how much ruckus the opposition creates, | 3230.68
Chintamani | 3232.2
Maharaj, Honorable Sir, please Chintaman Maharaj, | 3236.48
to me, Honorable Speaker, | 3238.799
Sir, I have come as an MP for the first time | 3242.839
and have got the first opportunity to ask questions. I am | 3245.96
thankful to the Honorable Speaker for this. | 3248.559
I have a question related to three or four railways. | 3255.4
In this, Ambikapur to Delhi Nizamuddin | 3261.319
Express runs once a week. If | 3265.44
it runs two days a week, it will be | 3270.359
very convenient for the businessmen there and the Ambikapur Delhi | 3276.16
Express which runs two days a week.  Its stoppage is at Vishrampur and | 3280.799
not at Surajpur. It would be | 3284.559
very good if it has a stoppage and the | 3289.16
devotees who go by train for Ayodhya darshan | 3293.4
go from their Surguja division and have to | 3305.16
come to Ambikapur from Ambikapur, which is about 100 kilometers from the route by which the train comes.  Then they have to go back home, | 3307.799
so for that, | 3318.48
they should take the train from wherever they are coming, this was my request and there | 3323.2
is only one platform in Ambikapur railway station, | 3329.72
due to there being only one platform, which  There is a second train, it | 3334.52
stops at Vishrampur or Kamalpur, so there is a | 3337.359
need for three more platforms there | 3340.92
and OK, Honorable | 3344.24
Member, Honorable Speaker, the train from Ambikapur to | 3347.599
Delhi, which the Honorable MP mentioned, | 3353.0
was in demand for a long time, that is why it was closed last year.  Perhaps it was | 3356.839
started not one and a half years ago but the | 3359.2
honorable MP has requested today | 3362.319
that this train should be | 3365.68
run two days a week instead of one day. I | 3368.16
will make every effort for this by | 3370.2
sitting with the honorable MP and  If possible and feasible then | 3374.039
it will definitely be implemented Question No. 26 | 3377.4
Vivek | 3379.319
Thakur Question No. | 3381.44
26 Honorable Minister, | 3384.359
Honorable Member, | 3387.599
Respected Speaker, the | 3392.72
progress that has been made in the IT and electronic sector in the last 10 years is | 3395.96
unprecedented but at the same time it was also | 3399.28
seen that  The NCRB data shows that the increase in crime in the field of cyber crime, especially | 3402.319
financial cyber crime, is | 3408.52
very shocking, that too by 24.4% | 3413.359
and with technological development, the | 3416.2
form and type of crime is also becoming new | 3418.44
and in rural areas we are seeing more crimes.  It is being seen | 3421.599
that both young men and women are | 3425.24
evolving in this and | 3427.319
somewhere they are also getting acceptance | 3430.079
because under the IT Act, there is a case | 3433.039
but it is very easy to get bail. | 3436.359
Conv only at 1.3 and  It is sad | 3441.839
when retired pensioners and elderly people are getting their | 3445.359
savings wiped out within a minute. I | 3447.64
think there | 3449.64
is equal need for both counseling and strict law. Speaker, | 3451.68
through you I | 3454.24
would like to question the Honorable Minister whether the government should take action against this issue.  It is | 3457.0
known that | 3459.44
all the sections related to financial cyber crime are | 3462.16
bailable sections under the Information Technology Act. | 3464.599
If yes, then what is the issue related to it. | 3468.319
Honorable Speaker, the honorable member has | 3472.2
asked a very important question and | 3475.2
I want to make him aware through you. | 3477.48
I am saying that as far as the Ministry of Electronics and Information | 3480.319
Technology is concerned, | 3483.039
which is an Act of the IT Act, the IT | 3489.2
Ministry makes provisions for various categories of punishment, | 3491.64
but as far as the action is | 3494.68
concerned, it comes under the Ministry of Home Affairs | 3498.359
and what the honorable member said is a little different from his. | 3501.28
I want to improve the information that there are 18 | 3505.68
such provisions under the IT Act which | 3508.76
come under the category of offense in which six are | 3512.68
non-available and 12 are available, then the | 3517.24
honorable members are saying that all are exempted, it is | 3519.359
not so and the present law. | 3525.76
Under the Indian Justice Code 2023 Act, | 3530.16
its provision has started from July 1, 2024 by the Ministry, | 3533.119
under Section 111, strict measures have been taken for cyber | 3537.559
crimes. The government is | 3540.72
fully cognizant that this is a very important | 3543.48
and challenging evolving situation where  As | 3547.559
I said earlier in India, there are more than 100 crore | 3550.72
mobile users, 70 crore | 3553.119
internet connections and every seven seconds | 3555.96
a new subscriber comes to India, | 3559.079
so with such a huge population and also | 3561.68
such huge challenges, the government has to face it. | 3566.559
Under the fully committed leadership of Honorable Narendra Modi ji, we | 3568.839
assure that our cyber space will be | 3572.0
kept safe, the interests of the citizens will be | 3574.559
protected and all provisions will be brought. | 3576.92
Thank you | 3578.46
[Music] | 3580.2
Thakar Aji, Minister has given a detailed answer. | 3584.76
I am also satisfied, but the | 3587.52
Kavi rate is a bit shocking. It | 3590.72
is only a cushion rate and its growth is | 3594.4
around 25. | 3596.599
Now in Delhi too, we have seen that its | 3599.079
size changes and its counseling is also the same. | 3601.799
Now there is a need, | 3604.079
half of Delhi's money was wasted by taking Indraprastha Gas Limited, | 3607.48
hence, what steps are being taken to check the growth that is happening sector wise. | 3618.4
Honorable Speaker, it is absolutely correct, there has been a | 3623.16
slight increase in the figures as | 3625.119
I have seen.  Said | 3626.52
that with such a huge population and a | 3629.52
new subscriber coming every seven seconds, but we have | 3632.079
various institutions like the National Cyber | 3634.48
Coordination Center which monitors the internet traffic, | 3638.28
wherever there is any disturbance, | 3640.96
it immediately informs the various institutions along | 3644.48
with blocking it -  Along with this, there are many | 3648.079
such sections in which punishment is also given | 3650.559
and we have achieved a lot of success | 3653.44
and there is an organization of the Home Ministry called | 3656.4
Farsi Indian Crime Indian Cyber ​​​​Crime | 3659.28
Coordination Center under which the National Cyber | 3662.88
Crime Reporting Portal is available on which | 3666.039
all complaints can be registered.  This can be given, there | 3669.4
is no need to go to the police station, a helpline has | 3672.2
also been issued under the number 1930 and | 3675.839
I want to tell the honorable member | 3678.079
that about Rs 2400 crore such scams have been | 3683.72
stopped by you, about 75 lakh 75 | 3688.0
lakh.  Individual citizens have been | 3691.319
protected by cyber fraud reporting | 3693.68
and in the future, as far as Conway is | 3697.76
concerned, it comes under the government, that | 3701.88
too is being done. Thank you Question | 3704.559
Number Over Honorable Members Speaker has | 3708.079
received a number of  Urgent Motions on | 3711.4
Different Subjects and He Has Not | 3713.68
Admitted Any True Notice | 3717.16
Papers to be Laid on the Table Item No. To | 3720.68
Dr. Jitendra Singh Esan Chairman Sir, with | 3723.68
your permission, I am today |
