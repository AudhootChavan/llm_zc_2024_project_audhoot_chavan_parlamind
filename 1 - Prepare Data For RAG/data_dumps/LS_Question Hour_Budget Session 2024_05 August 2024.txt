Honorable Minister | 37.36
Sir Honorable Finance Minister | 40.92
Honorable | 43.48
Members Speaker Sir We all know that | 48.6
India is an agricultural country and  Sir, in the | 52.48
state from where I come, Bihar, | 60.6
most of the farmers do farming in the land that is left due to flood and drought in the rivers, | 63.84
that is why, through you, I | 66.56
want to know from the Honorable Minister that farming | 69.08
farmers are truly given the opportunity to go to the banks. | 75.0
Honorable Finance Minister, Honorable | 78.439
Speaker, | 80.0
our Prime Minister | 83.52
was already the Prime Minister who conceptualized a developed India | 86.56
and if we see, | 90.479
agriculture sector has an important role in making India a developed country | 93.32
and hence  Our | 96.04
government has | 98.439
done a lot of work for the brothers for agriculture and farmers, like if we see, | 103.799
more than 52 crore people have been | 106.84
benefited in financial inclusion on the basis of Jan Dhan account, | 109.88
while if we see, this work has been done. | 112.439
As far as the maximum number of accounts were opened in marginal and rural areas, | 114.28
in 2014, where there used to be | 118.0
only 41,000 bank branches, | 124.399
in 10 years, we | 127.119
worked to open 54,000 bank branches in order to reach the banking facilities to the common people. | 129.84
As far as respondents are concerned, there were | 133.12
only 4 lakh respondents in 2014. | 136.4
In 2004, we have increased it to 11 lakh respondents. | 139.319
Our government has made | 141.4
sure that everyone within a | 143.36
radius of 5 km has access to banking facilities in the country. | 145.879
We should ensure that that facility is available so that | 148.4
people from far and wide can benefit | 150.519
and the result of all this is that if you see, | 153.44
as far as Kisan Credit Card is | 155.92
concerned, in 2014, | 159.239
426 Kisan Credit worth Rs. 4.26 lakh crore was given. | 163.0
Whereas in 2024, Rs 82 lakh crore is being given to the | 167.0
farmers through Kisan Credit through | 168.68
SSG Bank, but where it was Rs 7.3 lakh, it has been increased to Rs | 173.159
14481 lakh. | 176.12
Where Rs 1.8 lakh crore was given in rural development, Rs | 179.84
4 lakh 199 lakh crore was given.  Our government is | 182.319
doing the work of giving small loans in the same way | 184.879
through cooperatives | 187.2
where there was a provision of Rs 5437 crores. Now our | 190.959
government has done the work of giving Rs 5.56 lakh crores. | 194.239
Overall, if we look at the ground level | 197.04
credit given in the villages.  Till 2014, Rs | 200.28
7.3 lakh crore was given. Today it has been increased to Rs | 203.84
25.4 lakh crore in 2024. | 207.4
Somewhere in the village, people are getting the facility. The | 209.239
government will always try to ensure that people can avail it. | 211.519
Honorable | 214.0
member wants to ask a supplementary.  Sir | 217.2
Sir, President, in today's situation, it is | 221.439
very important that our youth population should be | 225.12
economically empowered. I | 228.56
want the Honorable Minister to please tell in this regard | 234.04
what efforts the government is making to strengthen the youth economically. | 238.319
Thank you Honorable Chairman, as far as the youth are | 241.72
concerned, I have said earlier also | 244.159
that 52 crore accounts were opened through banks | 247.159
in which most of the youth are included and | 249.68
in the last 10 years we have created 700 bank branches | 252.4
and  As far as | 254.84
apart from this our government started special schemes for the youth | 257.4
like internship which has | 259.68
just been announced in this budget Stand Up | 262.0
India Stand Up India Startups | 264.88
India including loan on education PM | 266.88
Vishwakarma PM Swayam Nidhi as well as | 269.32
Agar Dekh Mudra Loan  Under the Mudra loan, especially | 271.919
how we can provide 100 jobs to the youth, | 278.56
our government has done the work of giving loan of about Rs 30 lakh crore to 49 crore people. | 280.6
If we see in the budget of 2024-25, then the | 283.919
Mudra loan has been increased from Rs 10 lakh.  Its | 286.12
limit has been increased to 20 lakhs. This will | 288.0
benefit the youth somewhere. Mrs. Mawa | 293.8
Matra Thank you sir I would like to ask the | 296.88
minister through you sir I come from a rural | 299.759
area of ​​Krishnanagar in West Bengal and have seven | 302.28
very rural concrete areas bordering | 304.72
Bangladesh.  Most of the people are involved | 307.16
in agriculture and their access to credit | 309.56
is through the nationalized banks unfortunately when ever our | 312.08
farmers and small | 314.96
entrepreneurs from the nationalized banks their loans | 318.88
take an immense amount of time to get | 321.6
processed sir if there was any notification | 324.479
from your ministry to  The nationalized | 326.639
banks to set an outer limit to either say yes | 330.36
or no to the loan so say 30 days and 45 days so | 334.16
farmers and small farmers are not kept | 336.639
waiting for 90 days and then told that the | 338.96
loan is not approved due to lack of | 340.919
documentation.  IF YOU CAN SET AN OUTER | 343.039
LIMIT THEY MUST PROCESS BY 30 DAYS AND 35 | 345.68
DAYS YES AND NO THANK YOU SIR CHAIRMAN Sir, I approve of conducting an interim investigation of giving credit to the | 351.08
banks in so far as they provide services on commercial basis | 358.479
and if  So a system has been made in the bank | 361.759
that the redressal of complaints is | 363.96
done at three levels, that there is a Grievance Redressal Officer in all the bank branches, the | 369.36
contact details of the higher officer are compulsorily | 371.199
displayed, | 373.44
Redressal of complaints is done by various officers at the bank level. | 375.72
CP Gram will be registered by the Department/Ministry | 378.639
which is | 381.16
done within 30 days. The quality of disposal is | 385.639
ensured by the officer at the level of Coincidental Secretary. Also by the RBI, the | 388.12
time of RBI Ombudsman adjudicates the complaint | 390.8
and appeals.  Arrangements have been made, | 392.96
Mr. Pradeep | 396.08
Purohit, Chairman, I | 399.639
want to know this from the Honorable Minister through you. First of all, I | 402.44
want to thank our government | 405.0
minister that the scheme of Mudra Yojana which | 407.599
was Rs 10 lakh was increased to Rs 20 lakh.  The | 410.52
thing is that in our area, which is | 413.28
quite rural, there are more branches of SBI bank, | 415.4
but when it comes to printing, people go to get the | 417.919
currency and the officials | 420.56
think that they have become the owners | 422.52
and many people get disappointed in that.  There is | 424.759
whatever target is fixed by the | 426.759
Central Government, it will give a target to the bank, it will | 429.0
give a loan according to this target, this is such a | 430.96
result, will the Central Government take it? Honorable | 433.8
Speaker, I told earlier that the | 436.44
bank provides services somewhere or the other on the basis of business. | 443.96
Question No. | 447.12
182 Shri Anil Yashwant | 452.759
Desai Honorable Minister | 455.84
on the House Table Honorable | 463.639
Member Thank you Chairman Sir I would like to be a | 467.8
noble Minister Thank you Sir this incident has been taken | 472.919
Place at National Bird Park found its | 480.039
loss and kind of things that happened and | 485.08
investigation and inspection conducted | 488.72
by the government agency and the | 492.639
major cause was shown by the government as I came to know | 497.44
from the rebel minister but preventive | 500.72
steps are being taken by the government.  What ever reason are | 503.039
given that the birds were on the tamk or | 507.759
concrete surface That was the reason were they could | 511.0
not find water or anything so what steps are being taken | 514.36
by the Government to | 516.56
prevent this kind of thing National | 520.919
Bud | 522.599
Concrete Hon'ble Speaker Sir  The | 526.0
sensitivity with which the honorable member has | 529.8
raised the question about the death of the peacock is | 532.279
important because the national | 534.959
bird, the peacock, is | 537.0
so deeply embedded in our minds that even when we | 539.519
look at the top of the Parliament, | 542.36
which is its new architecture, the peacock is also | 545.32
marked in it.  As far as | 550.2
27 of our peacocks died during the summer season, as soon as | 554.959
they died, we had a fear that this | 558.72
infection which comes in birds is | 561.72
not an infection and for this we got their | 565.76
post-mortem done. | 568.04
After this, its viscera was | 570.839
also sent to Bareilly and Bhopal for examination, but this type | 573.6
of infection was not considered to be in its main | 575.68
region, it was caused due to heat stroke in summer. | 581.68
We have spent two centuries for the conservation of peacocks in the country. | 584.839
One of them is | 588.0
Adi Chachal Giri in Karnataka and the other one is | 592.04
Century which is also in Kolanur in South. We have declared it as a century | 594.68
but from time to | 597.32
time advisories are issued by us for its conservation | 599.76
and which is especially for them. | 602.04
We are also working for the protection of the protected area of ​​the century. | 603.839
Noble | 605.8
Member Thank you My Second Supplementary Sir I know from | 609.88
the Rebel Minister that the | 614.48
basic cause is global warming it leads to | 617.44
climate change and this is one of the region's wettest areas. | 620.92
See now my question to the Minister | 625.36
whether any consultation is in place with other | 629.32
national bodies because this is happening globally | 632.44
all over and since we are engaged in getting what is needed | 637.279
that emerging economy like | 640.32
India is going for technology expertise | 643.6
to get from the other countries.  In | 646.079
various areas to see that we can make | 648.639
progress in this very world that is | 651.959
biodiversity wildlife conservation | 654.6
what are the steps being taken internationally have | 657.44
you consulted and or engage any agency | 661.24
and what steps are being taken so that what | 663.88
century are being taken world and what they  Are being | 666.92
developed it should be in a proper way other wise this kind | 670.04
of things which have been | 672.24
reported this kind of accidental datas which have been reported they are | 674.0
big number and | 677.519
then they are not reported Thank | 681.2
you Honorable Speaker Sir Honorable Member has given more | 685.12
special  This question has been asked as a reference, | 687.8
I would like to tell them that there are | 690.44
three types of birds | 694.68
found all over the world, this one is found in our country, this is the | 696.76
Indian peacock, this is | 700.519
especially India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, | 702.8
Nepal, Pakistan.  And the | 704.76
second one which is Green Pea Fall is found in Sri Lanka, it is | 710.0
found in Cambodia, China, Indonesia and other parts of Asia and the third | 712.12
bird which is found all over the world and Congo | 714.92
is powerful, is found in the Republic of Congo, | 717.16
as per ICN report.  And there is an | 719.2
international report that the | 721.279
peacock found in India is the | 724.72
safest and the green peacock found in the rest of Cambodia and China | 731.519
is in danger and the one that is most threatened is the | 733.88
peacock of Congo.  There is a danger, | 737.199
we have | 739.8
also placed it under Schedule One in the wild life species and as the | 742.48
honorable member has said, it | 745.12
is not complete with just one bird, | 747.12
if we give protection to the circle of biodiversity, then all the | 749.88
birds are protected. Honorable Speaker | 752.12
Sir, I  Again, I want to repeat before you | 754.92
that the government is also sensitive regarding this | 757.639
and the Honorable Prime Minister | 759.8
gave the One Tree to Mother campaign because | 761.72
these trees are also useful for animals and birds | 763.959
and I have written a letter to all the MPs that it is | 766.079
certain.  If we all work together | 768.199
then we will solve this also, | 770.36
Mrs. Hema | 773.12
Malani, thank you. | 775.68
As we all know that India is a | 779.72
rich and leading country in terms of biodiversity, | 781.92
but it is also true that many | 785.32
animals and birds are in danger of extinction.  The | 794.44
government has come up with many schemes and policies to protect the seriously endangered and other extinct animals and birds but is | 798.32
not getting success. My | 801.76
question to the Honorable Minister is that the | 805.12
population of many birds including the national bird peacock in India is | 809.32
decreasing very fast.  And many species of birds are in | 813.199
danger. Even | 816.199
in Mathura, the city of Lord Shri Krishna, | 818.44
peacocks are rarely seen. In view of this situation, | 824.079
what | 826.48
special steps has the government taken during the recent years?  Has the positive | 830.199
results come out? | 834.279
Honorable Speaker Sir, the honorable member | 837.8
rightly said that it comes from Mathura and | 840.72
we can only see the peacock feathers of Lord Krishna, | 843.24
rest of our friends from Tamil Nadu also | 845.36
know that there  Lord Shiva | 848.72
's son Karthik also rides on a peacock, | 850.88
so the peacock is present in all our mythological civilizations. The | 853.6
honorable member has said that we | 858.0
run different programs for endangered species and especially for | 860.6
tiger conservation, lion conservation and elephant | 863.079
conservation.  So we do run it | 865.8
but as far as these endangered species are concerned, | 868.279
we also issue notifications from time to time | 870.92
and one of the biggest threats is | 874.079
that there are many birds which are | 877.32
hunted and many of their parts are used for | 880.48
many other purposes.  For this to be done properly, | 882.56
we take strict protection measures on behalf of our Crime Bureau. | 889.8
We have run breeding and conservation centers for the endangered birds and | 892.16
get the expected success in that too. Shri Ram | 895.519
Shankar | 896.48
Rajbhar Rama Shankar Rajbhar | 902.12
ji, Honorable  I want to know from the Minister through you | 905.12
that the Minister is aware that | 909.48
where there is forest, the wild life is | 912.44
safe there, but on the roads we have | 916.0
built, | 916.839
squirrels, | 921.639
cats, jackals, these small animals are not safe in | 926.519
summer.  During the month they go out in search of water | 929.199
and are being carried by our vehicles | 933.959
every day on some roads or the other. | 937.319
Our MPs must have seen that these creatures are dying in | 940.319
such a manner that in the plain areas, | 943.68
Honorable Speaker, the bushes are the first to be planted in the plain areas.  The | 946.279
population increased and farming took place. Due to the | 949.56
loss of bushes, the creatures that | 952.8
can live in the bushes and cannot fly, will | 955.04
remain on the trees. What is your question? My | 957.319
question is whether the | 960.279
government and the Honorable Minister have any | 962.079
plan to save these creatures.  Honorable Minister, | 965.399
Honorable Speaker Sir, the work we are doing, | 970.48
first of all, we are doing the | 975.56
work of management, planning and capacity building, we | 978.16
also do the work of our employees to save them, the rest | 981.24
like us, Wagh Mitra and Wildlife.  Jeev Mitra is | 983.36
made in the surrounding area for them, | 985.16
second one is made for anti-poaching and | 987.72
infrastructure development | 989.959
by the National Wildlife Board, all the mitigation | 992.0
plans are made for roads etc. | 994.759
Nowadays, we give permission only when | 997.519
they are fully implemented.  The underway they have is a | 1000.48
passway, unless they follow all the mitigation measures, | 1003.24
especially | 1005.079
around the forest areas, we do not | 1007.519
give them permission and | 1011.68
we give permission only after getting that infrastructure checked by the experts concerned. Third. | 1014.56
One topic is that due to population pressure | 1017.12
and other things, | 1021.56
we work to run programs for the restoration of the habits that are being destroyed. The | 1024.36
fourth topic is that of eco-development and | 1027.16
community oriented activities. | 1029.6
I | 1031.48
would also like to tell the honorable member that | 1033.439
if he | 1035.559
spreads publicity in his area along with our community oriented activities, then | 1037.48
definitely with his cooperation they | 1039.64
can be saved. Question No. | 1042.24
183 Shri Amra Ram | 1045.199
Ji Honorable Speaker Sir Question No. | 1048.039
183 | 1049.559
Honorable | 1051.24
Minister, Honorable | 1055.0
Member, Honorable Speaker, I | 1057.6
would like to know from the Minister through you, | 1060.72
how many people had invested in Sara Group and PSCL | 1063.72
and how much amount was invested | 1066.2
where the | 1070.72
order to deposit Rs 2781 crore from Sara Group is given by the | 1073.76
highest  The court had given and only Rs | 1077.0
15,775 crore has been deposited. Is the entire group's property | 1081.32
not left? Is it | 1084.88
not all the property? As far as the question of giving was concerned, out of Rs | 1091.559
1,775 crore, | 1096.2
only Rs 138 crore has been deposited from 2012 to 24 till date.  It has been given that | 1100.0
I would like to know from the Minister | 1103.2
that despite having more than Rs 15000 crore deposited in Sevi, why | 1107.0
only Rs 8 crore was | 1111.28
distributed, what is the reason behind this, | 1115.799
Honorable Speaker, as far as the honorable | 1118.76
member has expressed concern about Sahara Group, | 1121.919
I  Through you, I want to tell the House | 1125.039
that Sahara Group P.Sevi had passed an order against Sahara | 1128.159
India Railway State Corporation Limited and | 1130.6
Sahara Housing and Inter Investment | 1133.96
Corporation Limited, | 1136.039
regarding which they went to the Supreme Court | 1138.32
and in 2012, the High Court also appealed to Sahara | 1142.08
India.  Ordered Raila State Corporation Limited and | 1144.159
Sahara Housing Investment Corporation | 1146.12
Limited to return the | 1149.84
total | 1154.039
amount of Rs 2571 781 crore collected from 3.7 crore investors with 15% interest | 1159.28
in which | 1163.2
account of Sevi Sahara India was opened on 18922 in which Rs | 1166.36
157 75.5 crore was recovered and 2023  Between 2018 and 2018, the | 1172.159
Supreme Court constituted a committee under the | 1175.039
supervision of serving judge Mr. B.N. Aggarwal | 1177.48
and | 1180.76
publicity was spread by that committee in which | 1183.84
only 17526 people applied, against which | 1187.2
Rs. 138 crores have been returned. | 1190.0
And as far as the question is that | 1192.32
even after giving continuous advertisements, | 1194.96
no investor is coming to apply in it, hence Apple | 1197.6
again went to the Supreme Court to | 1200.159
seek opinion from the Supreme Court. I want to inform the House | 1203.039
that Modi ji's government is not working for our country. | 1211.84
I would like to thank the Minister and Amit Shah ji of the Cooperative Ministry of our Corporate Ministry that | 1214.039
keeping in mind the concern of the government for the poor, the | 1216.6
government itself went to the court and appealed that | 1221.32
our Sahara Group's 15000 157 | 1225.32
75000  Crores of rupees have been deposited, out of which only | 1228.919
crores of rupees have been disposed of, | 1231.88
somewhere in the cooperative, Sahara is also a Sahara | 1235.159
company, the money should be | 1237.6
transferred to the cooperative and the Honorable High | 1239.44
Court has also transferred Rs. 5000 crores to the | 1241.72
Corporate Ministry.  In | 1244.12
which if you see, it is also working | 1246.28
under the supervision of former judge R Subhash Reddy, in | 1248.919
which till 297 2004, 4 | 1253.96
36526 people have applied, out of which 374 rupees | 1258.6
11 crores have been refunded and these are the | 1261.36
large number of applications which are coming. | 1263.36
From this it appears that the system is fine, but | 1265.84
even after that, four toll-free numbers have been kept so | 1268.44
that whoever has any problem, whoever has | 1270.48
any facility can give it, hence the | 1272.6
intention of the government is to | 1274.64
return as much money as possible to the poor.  Item: | 1277.84
I had asked a pointed question that | 1280.76
how many people had invested in Sara and PSCL | 1283.2
and how much amount had been invested. Minister is | 1285.48
thanking the government, I am | 1287.559
not thanking the government. Question, I had asked | 1290.6
how much amount had been invested and how many people had invested in | 1293.679
both.  This question was asked in the companies, the | 1297.2
minister is not answering it, sir, as | 1299.64
far as I understand, you are patting the back of Sevi government, | 1302.48
Sevi and the government have | 1306.32
told that company itself, they have | 1313.36
done the work of releasing the cat from milk.  That Sara India should return the people's investment | 1316.279
money, why should this situation happen? | 1319.36
What is your question? My question is, | 1321.919
Mr. President, through you, how many | 1324.88
people have been pocketed by Sara India and | 1327.279
PSCL, and how much more has Sara India and PSCL done after 12 years. | 1330.6
Even only a few 15000 crores are the | 1334.84
assets of all India which the Supreme | 1338.279
Court has | 1340.08
deposited more than 25700 crores. Is there | 1343.36
no property of all India in | 1345.919
which 25000 crores of rupees have not been deposited | 1349.12
and they have not been divided after 12 years? | 1353.2
Also only 138 crores which is 15000 crores | 1356.799
crores more than this and what else will be the failure of the government | 1359.36
Honorable Minister | 1363.84
Sir AMS Pankaj Choudhary try to give the details | 1369.24
I just want to put entire Sahara matter | 1373.76

Taking Too Much Time But I Like To Put It | 1382.919

everything is being | 1410.2
monitored by the Supreme Court MS | 1412.84

like more Clemons to come there is a portal | 1837.36
createddrawarnavigator | 1840.57
[appreciation] If they have | 1858.279
people approaching them to please | 1861.519
less put legitimacy doubt about | 1888.96
the intention an interest in all | 1893.84
government | 1895.159
working Shreesh Singh | 1900.919
ji thanks  Speaker | 1903.399
Sir, | 1905.639
first of all there were people who | 1909.6
invested in Sahara and PCL, | 1913.399
whose number is in lakhs, | 1916.0
across the country, our people of Madhya Pradesh and | 1918.799
Satna had also invested a huge amount. | 1921.399
I want to thank the | 1924.08
Finance Ministry.  Hon'ble Finance Minister has been referred to the | 1926.799
Supreme Court and Sevi has taken very | 1930.399
prompt action and is | 1933.159
confiscating their assets and | 1936.039
working to return them to the investors. It is absolutely | 1939.159
true that all the | 1942.0
people have not received the money yet.  There were two types of | 1944.36
investors, one who invested through agents | 1946.88
and the other who invested directly. | 1949.76
Now some people do not even have the documents | 1951.84
and their claims are considered in the portal only | 1955.279
unless they have the papers. | 1957.679
So my Honorable  There is a request to the Minister | 1960.399
whether there will be such a system also, will he develop a mechanism to return the money to those claimants who | 1962.6
were given money through agents? | 1970.84
Sir, the | 1975.2
judges sitting in the panel will decide the mechanism.  They are supervising and | 1979.0
they decide, not the government, | 1982.44
because after all, in this matter, | 1985.2
when the case is going on under the supervision of the Supreme Court and | 1989.039
according to each regulator, there is a judge and his panel, | 1992.48
separate for SEBI and separate for the cooperative, that of | 1995.679
PAT Pearls Cooperative.  Apart from this, when there | 1999.24
is a committee under the leadership of judges, they decide | 2003.32
on which criteria we should refund the money, that | 2007.44
is why | 2011.559
we can present the suggestion of our honorable member Gan along with the judge, | 2016.2
but we are not the ones who decide, | 2020.0
Dharamveer | 2023.159
Gandhi Sir.  The property worth Rs 5,000 crore which was identified in the Justice Lodha Commission, | 2035.84
leaving aside the issue of BSCL of Pearl Company, what was done earlier was that the | 2044.08
property worth Rs 500 crore, which was located at a very valuable place, was acquired by Pearl. | 2047.399
Why was that money not returned to crores of investors? | 2051.639
Sir, why was this particular | 2054.879
property not selectively auctioned? Why was this property auctioned? | 2058.44
I do | 2062.679
not want to answer this one by one, | 2065.52
but the properties which have been auctioned by Sahara are | 2073.56
yes moment only.  I'm talking I'm putting it all together in one I explain | 2077.0
here and | 2079.919
then generically using the word sahara | 2087.399
sir | 2089.56
sir I'm allowed to give reply to noble | 2093.359
member ask question sir and after if you | 2096.48
permit they can have that then I'm willing | 2098.92
to | 2106.119
Answer | 2107.8
Sir, in this I want to say | 2111.28
Sahara Cooperative and | 2116.04
also Pal Agro Cooperation Limited, which member Honorable Member is | 2120.24
specifically referring, the property in which they have | 2126.64
invested also have | 2129.96
litigation | 2131.52
1070 | 2133.96
crores was recovered by Pearl Agro Cooperation | 2140.24
Limited | 2141.76
113 properties sold against 400 | 2146.599
properties so  I Just Want To | 2151.079
Recover 1070 Crore Tonnes But Several Other Properties | 2156.56
For P Grow And For The Cooperative In Sahara | 2161.4
Are Invested In Seriously Litigated | 2164.319
Property So The Property Papers May Be | 2167.0
Here But Auction Is Not Possible Till That | 2170.4
Litigation I Just Give An Example | 2172.64
Around | 2175.8
6643 Crows was invested in MB | 2180.0
Valley now MB Valley has very many other | 2184.44
litigation dimensions I am not getting into the | 2187.88
details so auctioning is very important because I have | 2192.04
the paper that can go to foreign auction if I am in so many | 2195.839
litigations so unless it is | 2200.359
clear  I can't go in right auction give | 2203.079

rebel member just listen because you have | 2210.96

Sir Sir, I am | 2302.56
giving a detailed answer to the Honorable Member who asked the original question on this subject, but if the Honorable Member, | 2305.92

Finance Minister | 2549.079
Question No. | 2552.04
184 | 2559.16
[Music] | 2571.96
Honorable Honorable | 2574.04
Member Sir My question is whether the | 2577.68
Government has formulated any scheme to | 2579.8
facilitate easy exit of | 2582.8
companies and  Another Question Question No. | 2586.0
B Part if so the silent features of the | 2588.48
scheme along with the current status there for | 2591.079
and Part C is the details of the | 2593.92
achievements made so for under the said | 2598.64
scheme Honorable Minister | 2608.44
asked the question and answered it | 2610.559
in writing.  And the Ministry of | 2614.4
Corporate Affairs is happy to tell me | 2617.599
that all the regulations for the incorporation of companies | 2620.92
and their regulation for their strike off and wind off are made by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The | 2628.559
question which has just been asked by the Honorable Member and has been tabled in | 2632.16
detail. | 2634.88
Honorable Member | 2637.559
Thank you Mr. Chairman Mr. Chairman, my | 2641.04
question to the respected Minister is that India's | 2642.92
economy has moved from 11th to fifth place | 2645.96
in the last 10 years and who has had the | 2648.839
biggest hand in gaining this entire achievement? | 2651.44
That is ease of | 2653.92
doing business. India has also achieved huge achievements in ease of doing business | 2656.599
in the last 10 years | 2658.559
and | 2661.559
in 2014 our country was at 142nd rank in the World Bank ranking | 2666.04
and today till 2019 we have achieved this 63rd rank. | 2669.88
In this, | 2672.76
we have achieved the achievement of 79 rank. My | 2675.359
question is that | 2678.04
under the Ease of Doing Business, what benefit does the Government of India give to these small companies which | 2681.119
want to acquire assets? First of all, | 2695.68
at the time of incorporation of companies in Ease of Doing Business, 2016  A | 2700.96
system of central system registration was created in the year 1977 | 2705.64
under which the company which earlier used to take 15-16 days to be | 2709.16
registered can get incorporated in one or two days | 2713.04
after submitting all the documents online | 2715.64
and | 2719.0
along with this, this huge task has become easier. | 2722.76
In doing business, it was done that for the | 2726.559
company to start its business, | 2729.839
all the necessary | 2733.16
documents like allotment of PEN, | 2736.599
allotment of 10%, registration of EPFO, | 2739.88
registration of | 2741.4
ESIC, opening of bank account are given to them within a day or two.  It was | 2747.52
given within the day itself along with the incorporation of the company | 2750.44
and similarly, if the company has to exit | 2755.359
then also the | 2760.16
provision for voluntary exit which was made in 2023 | 2763.92
for the voluntary exit of the company which was made | 2767.559
earlier.  It used to happen in two years, now | 2770.92
voluntary exit can be done in 80-90 days | 2772.599
due to online submission of forms | 2776.16
and within this, when people | 2779.72
apply for voluntary exit, the | 2783.2
biggest relaxation they get is that the | 2785.8
overdue financial statement.  And the | 2789.119
overdue annual return is that they do not have to submit it for the | 2792.92
financial year till which | 2795.92
they worked | 2799.52
and they have to give a statement. | 2803.559
Only Mr. Suresh | 2811.28
Matre Dr. Prashant Pole, | 2825.76
I would like to | 2828.24
ask a question to the Minister through you, | 2832.28
Ease of Companies.  Has | 2847.04
any special policy or rule been | 2849.2
made regarding the workers and other beneficiaries during the exit of the company? | 2852.48
How is the security of salary, allowances and other benefits of the workers being | 2855.16
ensured during the exit? | 2857.0
Respected Chairman, Sir, the honorable member has | 2862.119
asked a very important question when the | 2864.96
company  If there is a strike off, | 2868.599
then before the strike off, it is | 2871.839
ensured that the company | 2875.88
fulfills all its liabilities and | 2879.599
all the dues of its workers are paid on time | 2883.92
and | 2886.4
if and if even later the workers are paid the same.  Or if a | 2892.079
company with any liability feels that their | 2895.559
liability is pending or any work of the workers is | 2897.88
pending, then its provision has | 2901.24
also been made in the Company Law. | 2904.319
Question No. 185 | 2908.079
Shri Shashikant | 2913.16
Sil, Honorable Minister, | 2924.24
tell me it will start, it takes a second, | 2928.04
I ask you, | 2931.72
Minister.  About the way these loans are | 2941.76
dispersed to the kind of beneficiary and | 2944.4
also a lot of NPS so they have answered | 2948.4
my question I had asked for the average rate | 2951.839
of interest in  All these Mudra loans for | 2954.52
which a range is given which ranges from if I take | 2957.119
a public sector bank it is | 2959.599
9.15 to 12.80 and I take a private sector bank at | 2963.4
6.96 28 so my question is what | 2967.24
percentage of the loans are in the high end 20 ps | 2970.76
28  And there is minute huge amount of interest | 2974.119
being charged and what percentage is | 2976.839
NPA and there is mechanism from the government | 2979.92
to monitor the outcomes of this Mudra loan | 2983.4
and also there is so much of NPA coming | 2985.92
in Mudra | 2988.72
loss Honorable Chairman Sir I am Honorable Member  I | 2992.559
want to tell you that the | 2994.24
issue that has been raised that interest is | 2997.799
a very sensitive issue, | 3000.44
I want to put it on the table of the House in detail | 3003.319
that our Honorable Prime Minister had | 3010.24
started the Mudra Scheme after considering all the initiatives.  It | 3013.119
is mainly for those people who have | 3014.92
not taken any loan from the banking system till date, | 3018.0
that is why the government has not tried to limit the scope of any loan | 3020.48
like collet or any particular bank | 3023.44
etc. | 3026.04
In this scheme, any person who  Anyone who | 3028.92
wants to start any type of business | 3037.24
can take a loan from any bank or financial institution of his choice without any quota for his right plan. The interest rate is | 3043.52
de-regulated since 1994 as per the instructions of RBI, this government.  Not | 3046.52
all banks decide their interest rates | 3048.68
as per their own business interests. If the bank | 3051.2
interest rates are high or high, the | 3053.799
borrower has | 3056.359
complete freedom to take loan at a lower rate from government banks, | 3058.24
but one thing to note.  This is that | 3060.72
most of the loans under Mudra Yojana are being disbursed at low interest | 3063.119
rates Nabal | 3066.839
Member Speaker Sir It is very evidence Answer They have | 3071.48
no idea about what outcomes are | 3074.319
being created DrNavigator | 3086.599
What is the mechanism you have to monitor the | 3089.68
way in which  Losses Are Dispersed What Rates They Are | 3092.28
Being Dispersed What Harassment People | 3094.72
Are Going Through Because of Recovery and What | 3097.72
is the Outcomes Coming Out of Mudra | 3104.48
Losses Permit Me to Answer This Question Sir The | 3108.68
Rebel Member was right in saying the | 3111.92
interest rate is a range  That we given that it | 3115.559
is in the private sector banks it is about | 3118.68
9.15 | 3120.64
12.80 and for the private sector banks | 3123.72
it is about 6.96 to | 3126.68
28 but we have not necessarily understood what is | 3130.96
going on on the ground every year data is collected | 3134.559
and banks follow it both.  Recovery | 3139.559
Harassment Is Something to Put Very Clearly on | 3143.16
the Table Very Welcome Member Has | 3146.96
Instances of Harassment Going on Some Which We Will | 3150.119
Definitely Attend to But No NPA | 3153.839
Numbers I'm Willing to Give Here Because of the | 3156.839
Narrative Members Asd I'll Definitely Give It | 3159.359
But  Recovery harassment is something which we have been very | 3163.52
close monitoring and I can say for sure | 3166.44
the public sector banks are very closely | 3169.0
monitored so also the NBFCs but as said if there are | 3172.359
cases we are very willing to hear it as per what we do. | 3174.68
Have a system | 3179.48
with which we collect the data I want to put it | 3182.079
for the rebel member through you | 3184.44
sir the PM Mudra Loan NPA on | 3187.88
disbursement and I will give it for every | 3190.4
year since 20181 1920 2021 up to | 3195.599
232 so if anything the NPA the NPA  I only | 3201.24
coming down the Public Sector Bank NPA on | 3204.44
Dispersion for Mudra Loan was | 3207.68
3.76 in the year 1819 gradually | 3212.44
it did go up to about 4.8 in 1920 2021 | 3217.559
it went to 4.77 but now it is back to 3.4 | 3222.16
in fact lower then  What it was at the | 3224.24
beginning in 2324 Now Private Sector | 3227.28
Commercial Banks Sir Mudra Loan as NPA was | 3232.04
0.67 in 1819 it went up to about 1.7 7 | 3237.079
2021 the Covid year now even for them it has come | 3240.52
down to | 3241.88
0.95 RRB also give Mudra Loan they had a | 3246.28
3.86 in 1819 S NP Dispersion High | 3252.88
which has Come Down Now for the RRB to 2.47 | 3256.72
Par Small Finance Banks Also Give Mudra | 3259.92
Loans and for Them NPA on Disbursement is | 3264.2
3.38 and Went Up to | 3267.52
3.09 Ch Actually Reached to 0.39 During | 3271.96
2021 Highest Being in 189  But that came | 3275.76
down to 0.76 so I want to highlight the | 3280.52
fact that even State Cooperative Banks are | 3283.44
giving PM Mudra Loan | 3286.76
NBFC whose rate of interest is slightly | 3289.559
higher than the Public Sector Banks even when | 3293.0
the NPA on dispersion was in | 3297.96
047 ch now.  Come to | 3301.559
022 Overall Mudra Loan | 3306.2
NPA Diss at 0 | 3309.76
Mr. Dush Singh | 3316.96
Ji Ardia | 3320.96
Mam Shishu Loan Mudra Loan | 3324.28

Like Lakhpati Didi to Improve Them in | 3363.72
Mudra Loans to  Self Help Groups to | 3366.44
Increase in Farming | 3369.64
Sector Sir Farming sector largely gets | 3372.64
covered under the KCC and the farm loans and | 3376.079
also related loans Mudra loan is | 3378.799
essentially given for small businesses even if they are | 3381.76
agriculture related but businesses they are | 3384.599
so I just want to highlight  That feature | 3388.64
and leave it for the member but in case he has | 3390.68
some suggestions to give us we would be quite happy | 3392.799
to take | 3396.359
it Su Shri Pranati | 3402.079
Shinde A sir I would like to ask | 3405.48
that a lot of villages are taking | 3408.44
are adopted  By certain nationalized banks | 3411.2
but at the moment there are two to three defaulters | 3413.359
in two villages the ante has to pay for it | 3416.68
and the banks refuse to give the other people | 3419.359
in two villages they may be farmers they may be | 3421.48
youth loans based on the fact that the  To other | 3424.52
people that to people from that particular | 3426.48
village have defaulted and then when they take | 3429.16
the grievances to the collector the collector says that | 3431.68
this is not under my control | 3434.359
it is under the control of the | 3436.599
RBI because of which a lot of  Villages have | 3439.72
not been able to avail of the facility of the | 3442.359
Mudra Loan so Madam Prime Minister will something | 3445.52
happen and they are just to | 3448.76
default in the villages. | 3455.0

Every Area I Will Take It Very Serious | 3477.359
This Is Absolutely Not The Way In Ch  Mudra | 3480.96
