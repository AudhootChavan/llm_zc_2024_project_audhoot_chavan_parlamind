on the example of the NDA Government and also | 498.919
the vision of NARAL Prime Minister has also been | 501.72

historic decision has been taken regarding this | 512.719
sir were the inverted GST which covers | 515.719
the components and the MRO services that is there to be lifted | 520.519
on 12th of July | 524.24

NARAL Finance Minister who has also recognized | 568.44
that the MRO sectors needs a lot | 570.56

potential here and because of which in the | 574.68
Union Budget 2024  25 The Finance Minister has also | 578.32
given an assurance that the | 580.8
period for export of goods imported | 582.959

specifically in Rajasthan we have to MRO | 820.56
right now sir and which is Himalayan Heli | 823.519
Services a which is near Jaipur and also | 827.279
Aviana Aviation Pvt.  Which is near a | 830.32
Kishangarh Ajmer and regarding the MRO | 833.079
Setting up of MRO Anywhere in the | 834.759
country The Airports Authority of India | 836.6
Which is under Central Government It has | 839.68
taken out all the royalties that are required | 842.04
for setting up of MRO so that it is the | 844.12
process  We have given a card rate right now | 846.8
so any one who wants to set up an MRO anywhere | 848.88
in the country let it be an air | 851.12
strip let it be an airport anywhere we | 853.56
will follow due diligence and we want to | 855.68
anchor MRO more and more from our  A | 859.04
government site so definitely if there is any | 861.32
proposal from anywhere in the country even if it | 863.399
is the remotest part of the country if there is an | 865.6
airport if there is an air | 867.399
strip we will provide the necessary | 869.48
assistance and MRO facility is very much in my honor. | 872.56
The Minister has given a very good and very | 876.56
detailed answer. I don't think | 879.16
anyone has given a good answer. Shashi Tharoor | 884.88
ji. Thank you so much Mr. Speaker. Actually there are | 887.639
three things missing in the answer of the | 890.92
Rebel Minister and I do want to draw.  His | 893.72
Attention Too Sir Because There Are Three Challenges The | 896.639
MRO Sector Faces Not Been Addressed In The | 899.16
Written Answer The First Is What The Ministry | 902.24
Anticipates To Be A 4 Billion Dollar | 904.279
Industry It Talks | 909.6
Unfortunately | 911.68
Fleet Size In India What About Ambitions | 914.519
For The International Fleets There Are Many | 916.32
Many International Airlines That Could Stop In | 918.279
India For Example Thiruvananthapuram Is On The | 920.32
Route Between Europe And Oceania And | 923.199
South East Asia We Would Be Able To Offer | 925.079
MRO Facility There But In Fact You Are Not Our | 928.319
Standards In India Are Not | 930.279
Regulated By The Europeans  Authorities And There | 933.959
For We Are Not Able To Integrate We Need To | 935.92
Harmonize Our Regulatory System To Meet The | 938.48
Global Standards Second Sir As My My | 942.04
Respected Colleague Dushyant J Mention The Industry Has | 944.68
Not Been Integrating Well Into The Complete | 947.44
Value Chain That Evolve The OE And And This | 950.959
Is creating a problem with Internationally | 953.36
Recognized Airline Operators and Globally | 955.88
Recognized MRO Entities and the Third | 958.959
Concern You mentioned various incentives but you said | 961.759
nothing about whether we can include | 964.88
MRO under Production Linked Incentives The | 968.12
PLI Scheme of the Government The | 970.04
Parliamentary Standing Committee on | 971.68
Commerce has tabled  A Report Last Year | 974.319
Saying That The PLI Scheme Should Be | 976.04
Extended To The MRO But You Have Been | 977.92
Silent On That In Your Answer Mr. | 979.48
Minister Thank You Mr. Chairman O One More | 982.36
Thing Sir Thiruvananthapuram A I Said Is Such An | 984.519
Ideal Location But We Hear That  AIR | 987.16
INDIA HANG M HANG DE ARE APPARENTLY | 990.399
PLANNING TO ACQUIT FUM WHAT INCENTIVES CAN | 992.88
YOU OFFER SO ASSISTING HANGAR SURVIVE RD THEN | 995.639
ONLY OPENING A SAR THE REBEL MEMBER HAS | 999.48
MENTIONED THREE DIFFERENT POINTS AND THE FIRST | 1001.8
ONE IS REGARDING HARMONIZING WITH THE | 1004.72
INTERNATIONAL BODIES AND ESPECIALLY A  Mention | 1007.639
about what is the European equivalent | 1009.759
of DGCA which is there with us and f what is | 1012.36
the American equivalent of DGCA and | 1014.72
I don't agree with him totally sir when he says that we are | 1016.72
not harmonizing with the | 1018.88
national bodies because we understand when we are | 1021.519
Setting up our MRO facility It | 1024.28
is not just for the airlines that are there | 1026.559
Indian Airlines in the country also MRO we | 1029.199
want to create the atmosphere where | 1031.559
international airlines also come and access | 1033.72
our facility and for that we are | 1036.6
harmonizing we are anchoring our MRO | 1039.24
facility  To harmonize their regulations | 1042.039
with the IA European body and also the | 1045.64
FA so it is a work in progress and I have also mentioned | 1047.88
the Boeing and Airbus they are also in to | 1050.96
this an MRO sector so when these | 1054.2
international bodies come in to play | 1056.24
definitely  They bring in all the regulations which are | 1058.08
recognized globally so definitely | 1061.44
yo your point is well taken but I don't totally agree when | 1063.36
you say that we are not | 1065.039
working in that direction it is a work in | 1066.799
progress it is definitely doing and also others than | 1069.08
that sir  The PLI scheme and I am | 1072.24
happy that the member acknowledges that | 1074.6
PLI is a very good scheme which this | 1077.12
NDA government has started under the | 1079.12
leadership of Prime Minister Modi ji and | 1081.919
definitely we take that we have got the | 1084.28
recommendation through the committee also and | 1086.24
definitely  Although this PLI incentive has been | 1088.84
introduced to any sector there has been | 1091.679
observation of huge growth potential | 1093.88
and definitely we are going to consider this | 1095.96
and we are going to see what best can be done | 1098.48
for MRO to be linked up with PLI | 1100.96
and we from the Ministry  Definitely would | 1102.96
anchor more money coming in to our | 1105.0
ministry also so we are going to try regarding it | 1106.919
and others than the | 1110.44
Thiruvananthapuram MRO facility I am going | 1113.12
to ensure that it does not stop | 1115.0
anything that any support that is required | 1116.919
from our ministry we are going  To | 1118.799
Provide So That The MRO Goes Forward Thank You Thank You | 1120.799
Question No. 243 Umesh Bhai | 1124.0
Babu Bhai | 1127.08
Paten Sir, thank you, our small | 1130.96
state Daman Dev, even after so many years of independence, the | 1133.88
people of our state do not get | 1136.2
enough drinking water.  The whole | 1139.4
problem is that the water available to the farmers is the | 1142.36
water of canals and ponds, which is being | 1144.76
taken by the liquor makers. Farmers and factory | 1147.559
owners are very worried and are facing shortage of water. | 1150.0
My question is related to this, | 1153.48
I want to ask the Water Minister.  Is the | 1156.52
Government proposing to supply safe drinking water in the Union Territory of Daman and Dadra and Dadra and Nagar Haveli? | 1161.96
If yes, | 1167.12
what is the status of the ongoing scheme of work in this regard and the amount of funds to be spent by the Government during the last five years? | 1171.6
What | 1174.72
is the matter? Does the government | 1178.28
propose to build a dam on the Kale river for water supply in Daman? | 1180.52
If yes, when will the dam be constructed? | 1182.799
Honorable sir, one minute, you have to | 1187.64
say the question number first, sorry, after that the minister will | 1190.72
say sorry.  After all, your | 1193.679
question has already been asked, still you can | 1197.24
ask supplementary later. Honorable Minister, | 1200.64
Respected | 1202.0
Sir, the answer to question A and B has been placed on the table of the House. | 1205.559
Honorable | 1210.0
Sir, if the member is new, there might be some mistake, | 1213.159
okay, no problem, water.  Does | 1215.12
our government have | 1217.84
any plan for Daman Diu for water supply? If so, when will it be | 1221.88
completed? | 1224.159
Whatever plan our government has for Daman Diu for water supply, | 1226.64
when will it be completed? Thank you | 1229.53
[Music] | 1231.24
Honorable | 1232.919
Sir Member | 1236.679
I feel very happy while telling about the question that has been asked by | 1241.6
Dav Daman and | 1245.159
Selvas, their LGs, they have collected | 1255.64
more money from the same money for the beauty fund set up by respected Prime Minister Modi ji. | 1259.48
He has managed to provide 100% tap water to everyone's homes. He did | 1267.52
not ask for money from our Ministry. | 1271.0
Even when we offered to give it, he refused. He did it with his | 1274.039
own money as per the rules of the Ministry. | 1276.6
Very good.  While | 1279.679
making arrangements, 100% work has been done there and it has | 1283.48
also been certified by all the Sarpanches, | 1287.039
so if one completes the work at 100%, there is no problem or | 1294.2
we do not have any problem of water or any complaint. | 1298.88
Supplementary Sir, I want to tell the Minister | 1302.36
that an inquiry committee should be set up for this and | 1306.52
water is still not available in 90 areas of our state. The | 1310.64
administration is only | 1313.76
taking awards and the water supply has | 1316.88
not reached there. So I request you.  I | 1319.96
want that a | 1322.52
caste committee should be set up for water supply and the situation of our state should be | 1325.159
assessed. | 1326.96
Honorable | 1329.159
Sir, I told you earlier also that | 1331.88
100% work was done here, | 1335.6
no money was taken from the ministry, no help was taken.  I went to Gaya | 1338.72
and all the Sarpanches there and all the Sarpanches have | 1345.679
certified that water is available in all the houses in their villages. The first one is a | 1349.799
UT where 100% work has been certified. | 1352.88
We do not have any complaint | 1356.08
or complaint.  Since he is not there, the | 1358.32
question of setting up a committee does not arise. | 1360.48
Thank you Shri Ram Shrimani Verma | 1363.96
ji, thank you very much, Chairman, my | 1368.48
Lok Sabha constituency, Uttar Pradesh, which is an aspirational | 1371.679
district, Sravasti | 1373.919
Balrampur, just like all the other districts come to the | 1376.6
border area to guard the country.  For this, the | 1380.44
SSB soldiers who are deployed on border security on the Nepal border | 1384.08
and many outposts have been built | 1388.44
and there are many villages too, they have to | 1393.48
bring water for drinking from about 10 kilometers away, | 1396.64
so I want to know from the government in this regard, | 1401.559
Honorable Minister.  Will the | 1404.08
government take any concrete steps to provide clean drinking water to those soldiers and the people living in those villages? | 1415.679
Respected | 1417.679
Sir, the government has provided water to about 77 i.e. | 1422.76
15 crore houses through Jal Jeevan | 1427.2
and  Water | 1430.6
is also fit for drinking. | 1433.159
I had earlier also wanted to tell you that | 1436.039
in the villages of Gujarat bordering Pakistan, | 1439.0
where the | 1441.24
soldiers are there to protect us on the surface, there | 1444.64
was no provision of water there and that too. | 1448.08
When the respected Prime Minister was the Chief Minister, | 1450.2
he has made arrangements for tap water there. | 1452.96
Here too, it has been done in 77 cases. | 1456.48
This is the work of the states. Tendering is done | 1460.2
within the DPR prepared by the states and wherever they | 1462.679
want to provide water.  Also, the | 1465.399
state government does it and within it, they receive technical | 1468.72
assistance and funds from the Ministry. | 1472.84
Wherever the scheme is, we are fully | 1476.08
helping within it and making arrangements to provide water to everyone. | 1478.76
NK Prem | 1483.88
Sanji Sir, this program is Jal Jeevan Mission.  The | 1486.799
program is not the best program | 1490.559
but it is practically not possible | 1494.48
to achieve the objective but the | 1498.88
basic issue is the availability of water and | 1502.2
access to the water. The basic issue is the | 1506.72
mission to my experience is water. | 1508.6
Resources Minister During the first phase in the | 1510.48
State of Kerala we are now | 1514.48
facing very big difficulty regarding | 1517.12
availability of water as well as access to the | 1520.039
water. Mission Totally Intending to have | 1524.64
public water to the households Sir Ma | 1528.48
Experience in the State  Of Kerala it has become | 1530.48
an engineering | 1532.159
project instead of providing water you are | 1535.44
giving tap connection by putting the service | 1537.88
lines and giving tap connection but | 1543.12
unfortunately | 1552.919
the water tanks infrastructure development | 1556.0
of the water sector other wise it will be few | 1558.64
as the government is not going to.  Achieve the goal | 1562.08
by having safe and portable pup drinking | 1565.08
water to fill the specific question I would like | 1568.0
to ask from the honorable minister.  Did | 1583.72
n't pay attention to it, | 1585.919
that's why | 1589.679
listen to it years ago, listen to | 1593.15
[praise] if | 1597.6
this work had been done in 70 years, then | 1600.76
this problem would not have been discussed in the House today. | 1604.6
Respected Prime Minister got | 1612.72
almost water because of this a year ago.  I made this plan to provide water through tap, | 1616.24
I had just said in the answer | 1618.919
that water arrangement has been made in 77 houses in rural houses, | 1623.0
safe | 1625.76
water has been provided there, | 1628.679
you listen | 1632.0
brother, water is very clear in life.  Whether the scheme is | 1637.24
implemented by the state government or it is the | 1640.08
responsibility of the state government, | 1644.88
they also decide whether ground water is available or surface water is available. | 1647.72
If surface water has to be brought from a long distance, | 1650.08
then its cost also increases. | 1652.72
Nevertheless, we do not deny anything in that. The tendering is | 1655.72
also done by the state government itself. | 1658.64
After the DPR is approved, the financial assistance and | 1662.32
technical assistance is given by us. The | 1664.799
respected member just asked that there is a | 1667.159
water problem in our place in Kerala.  And | 1670.44
if there is any particular somewhere then our | 1672.519
tax force will be sent and checked | 1675.2
but till now no one has come to our attention | 1678.32
because in Kerala they have said that there | 1680.24
is full water there and because of providing safe water | 1683.399
this scheme is being implemented.  What was important was that today one and a half | 1687.159
hours are being saved for women all over the country. | 1690.519
Women have benefited a lot from it. | 1693.159
They used to have to go many kilometers to get water | 1696.08
and today they do not have to go and from the | 1698.88
health point of view also, it is | 1701.48
almost  8 lakh crore has been saved in this, it has | 1705.72
happened due to the scheme, even if there | 1707.44
is a report of WHO, then | 1709.44
on the basis of this report also, it can be said that the scheme was | 1711.48
very necessary and 15 crore has been reached in tax, | 1714.48
then the rest of the work is also done by the state.  He is | 1717.24
moving ahead and has the support within him | 1719.12
and will do it soon Question No. | 1721.88

Ji Answer | 1732.519
Sir Question No. 244 | 1735.72
Sir Thank you Sir | 1738.559
I am very thankful to Noble Minister Katkari Ji | 1742.279
for responding to my question. | 1744.399
Sir would you like to know about the at stage | 1748.96
of this project and further how should we | 1752.36
go ahead about starting this project Sir | 1755.2
this project is essential and basic | 1757.0
necessary for the people of Anantapur Sir because of the | 1759.84
urban expansion of Anantapur city Primer | 1762.799
Directed  West Word Due to Geographe Konst | 1766.44
Sach Bach Lake and Near By Hills Sar a | 1770.32
led to significant industrial commercial | 1772.44
and residential growth on either side of the | 1774.76
existing National Highway 44 Bypass Road Sar | 1777.559
Over the years this bypass road has transitioned | 1781.08
from a primary bypass to local road | 1784.279
Held by increasing traffic congestion, the | 1787.36
construction of fly overs have been insufficient to | 1789.96
handle the rising traffic | 1792.44
volume resulting in substantial | 1795.279
traffic moving through the city. To address this issue, | 1798.64
the Master Plan of Anantapur includes the | 1801.12
proposal for second bypass as follows.  A | 1804.36
detailed study and approval by the Andhra | 1806.279
Pradesh Administration on this new bypass | 1809.12
intends to lift the traffic congestion in the | 1813.519
city and manage through traffic more | 1816.039
effectively along with the city layer | 1819.76
development pattern around the current A 44 bypass. | 1823.08
Implementing this second bypass is | 1825.12
crucial for | 1848.0
I will request the members to | 1852.48
bring it either in writing or in the shirt.  Questions to be | 1859.519
taken by the Speaker | 1861.48
Sir The Proposal Presently we do not have any | 1865.519
proposal for suctioning the Ring Road for | 1869.48
Anantapur currently existing with three | 1872.36
bypasses with total length of 2775 km | 1877.0
covering 60 per cent of the outer periphery of the | 1880.08

make the study of these things and will find | 1931.0
out the option and if it is to be needed for | 1933.96
the city when we have new ring road or something  We | 1937.44
can attach some ring road part off road | 1940.279

resolve the issue we will again make the study of | 1946.76
thank you sir | 1949.12
Mrs. | 1964.799
Mr. Rang Appa | 1970.48
became the Honorable Speaker. | 1974.48
Sir, in my parliamentary constituency, a bypass road was built from Pho to | 1979.72
Devad Ravet, further to Chandni Chowk, further to | 1983.72
Kolhapur, | 1987.159
which was built by Reliance Company and now the | 1992.799
condition of the road has become so bad that there are many potholes in the rains, | 1995.2
so I  I want to know from the Minister | 1998.0
whether | 2001.32
your ministry is terminating the old proposal and taking a new proposal. | 2010.88
Speaker Sir, what the honorable member is saying is | 2014.44

Bypass.  And it is | 2025.44
owned by Reliant Infrastructure, the condition has become very bad in this rainy season. | 2028.679
By law, there have been many problems on this road | 2032.159
for many years. I have tried many times to | 2035.44
find a route by intervening but it has not been | 2038.12
possible. But as you are saying, this road is a | 2041.6
win-win situation.  With mutual | 2043.12
understanding, because we did something, | 2045.399
went to court and then got stay, if | 2047.36
problems arise, we are trying to | 2050.2
terminate them and | 2053.0
prepare a new DPR and try to solve whatever problems you have on this road. | 2056.04
In the | 2058.48
process we will try to resolve this issue | 2061.399

Iran because the Prime Minister had sent me, | 2144.32
so | 2145.64

I am sorry for that | 2152.16
but it is an important thing sir, this | 2156.04
subject is only related to Ring Road of | 2158.359
Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh.  But Rebel Banerjee | 2162.16

I will check if our  If there is a road, then | 2250.16

necessary and the solution will be planned after discussing it with them. | 2255.28
Question No. 25 Shri Anurag Singh | 2259.48
Thakur Sir Question No. 25 Honorable Minister has | 2263.64
given on the table. Honorable | 2267.72
Member, Honorable Speaker, he has | 2270.56
answered my question in great detail.  It is | 2273.48
given in | 2275.88
which how the Modi government, knowing the importance of micro small scale industries, has implemented | 2280.2
wonderful | 2282.44
programs beyond that, whether it is the | 2285.68
Employment Guarantee Generation Programme, | 2288.28
Credit Guarantee Scheme, schemes like RAM | 2291.4
or Cluster Development Program or the | 2294.0
talk of making technology Pak.  Yes, everywhere | 2297.48
and the credit linkage that was talked about has also been | 2302.119
increased many times more than before, for which | 2304.319
I would like to congratulate and thank the government a lot | 2309.28
because micro small scale industries are a | 2312.64
sector where employment is also created. | 2314.599
My question, Honorable Speaker.  This is that | 2317.8
if we take the data of the last 20 years, | 2321.0
10 years of UPA government and 10 years of NDA government, | 2329.079
what was the contribution of the governments in economic development and employment generation, what | 2332.119
figures can you tell and for the next 10 years | 2335.48
this  What is the policy of the government as to | 2338.52
how many jobs will be created in this sector | 2340.839
and how much contribution will the MSME sector make in the economic development? | 2349.359
Sir, we express our gratitude to the honorable | 2352.119
member that the programs are being run by our department under the | 2356.0
leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. | 2361.8
He praised it, although his answer was to the | 2366.4
question, we have | 2369.96
given all the figures regarding that question, now | 2374.8
what progress has been made during the NDA period and during the UPA period, | 2379.24
we are not available about it, we will give it to the | 2381.48
honorable member later. | 2384.319
But | 2387.119
but the question is, there are important things in the question | 2391.56
which are in front of the country today and the Prime | 2395.4
Minister has also given a lot to it and in | 2399.64
this also he has asked in the last question, | 2401.56
what are your views about women?  And | 2408.319
we are also especially concerned about women and youth, so | 2410.88
what he has talked about women, especially about | 2413.64
Hamirpur district and about providing | 2416.2
MSMA assistance to the women entrepreneurs of the country, | 2421.52
we are in that.  People have done many things, | 2425.119
first of all we have started the Credit Guarantee Scheme | 2427.8
in which we provide | 2432.56
loan guarantee up to 85% to different categories of people through Micro Small Industries Credit Guarantee Fund | 2435.8
and as far as it comes | 2439.359
in MSC 500 500  Collector free loan to the extent of Rs. lakh has been made, | 2448.64
similarly secondly, | 2455.28
we have also done equity inclusion of Rs. 50,55,000 crore | 2459.8
for these people through Atmanirbhar Bharat Fund. Then if we | 2462.599
move ahead, then MCME | 2465.52
New revised criteria for classification of | 2471.24
MSMEs have been introduced for ease of doing business. New registration of MSMEs has been done through Origin Registration | 2474.4
and there will be | 2478.76
no global tender for procurement of Rs. 200 crores especially | 2482.359
for women.  It is a very big thing | 2484.839
sir, in the same way from 2021, | 2488.76
MA and CMA have been included in retail and wholesale trade, which | 2491.8
means there should be | 2494.92
all round development of women, | 2498.44
we have made concrete arrangements regarding employment | 2500.88
and  Their basic question is that what is the | 2503.76
difference between NDA and UP, | 2506.359
we will give it later on the table or | 2508.96
to the Honorable Member. Honorable | 2513.68
Member Sir, my first question | 2517.88
which is related to Hamirpur by the Honorable Minister is | 2521.2
very good in written form.  The reply came and I | 2523.8
thank their department for very detailed | 2525.56
information. Ok thank you, no sir, my sir, | 2528.2
no sir, my supplementary, sir, my | 2531.2
supplementary, which was the first answer, the | 2533.079
honorable minister has said that he will | 2534.92
give it later, which will be related to UPA vs NDA. | 2538.2
How big a difference has been made in 1010 years, how has | 2540.64
the contribution been, Sir, I have one thing that the | 2543.96
Pradhan Mantri Vishwakarma Yojana is also | 2546.8
a very good scheme which is going to give a huge contribution to the deprived, | 2549.96
exploited and backward class people of the country. | 2554.28
I thank you for that too.  I am sure that it is a very good | 2556.8
program that you are coming up with and | 2561.0
you have also made a provision in it that | 2564.88
women are going to get huge benefit in it and in that too, | 2567.4
sir, the biggest | 2570.079
thing is that the percentage for women has been | 2572.92
kept better in it.  Sir, I have only one | 2576.559
second question | 2578.52
that the | 2582.599
Honorable Minister and | 2584.72
his department are able to see what | 2586.359
challenges are there in the field of micro small scale industries today and | 2589.72
what steps have you taken in the last 10 years to address those challenges, | 2592.8
which will have an impact.  And the result of which you | 2595.68
want to see in the next 10 years, that much contribution will be made | 2598.119
in our MSME sector, please | 2603.44
elaborate on the | 2606.119
things that have been discussed with the Chairman, what efforts are being made | 2610.92
in this regard, the | 2614.44
honorable member himself has said many things. | 2616.52
And more recently, | 2620.68
whether it is through Jaspi scheme, | 2624.8
PMG EGP scheme or | 2628.48
credit guarantee card, | 2634.76
we are doing all this work with this purpose and  I | 2637.119
also came | 2638.8
to know about one thing that he had said earlier, the amount of work that was done in the Credit Guarantee Scheme | 2641.8
in the first 22 years, | 2645.76
we have done the same in the last 2 years only. Yes, and | 2649.8
4.8 crore enterprises have been registered on Enterprise Porter, | 2654.44
sir.  This is also a matter of record and | 2657.24
it can be understood | 2661.16
how actively the MSME department is working to fulfill the dream of Honorable Narendra Bhai | 2664.0
Modi ji. | 2666.68
Thank you | 2672.16
Sir Shri Anil | 2675.599
Desai Thank you Chairman | 2678.64
Sir Sir in the answer  Given by the | 2682.8
Minister as mentioned in the Government has taken | 2685.8
number of initiatives to support MSME out | 2689.119
of that point number 11 says the lunch of Udyam | 2692.92
assist platform to bring informal | 2695.599
micro enterprise under the formal aim | 2698.28
for availing the benefit under priority | 2700.359
sector landing is a very good  Welcome | 2702.28
Step Sir Sir My Question Supplementary | 2706.48
Question I need to ask has a | 2709.24
background after the de monetization shock came suddenly because | 2713.16
informal economy in | 2716.839
the country like India was prevalent | 2720.44
for decades not only decayed by century together | 2723.8
and it was  Not | 2727.16
and any wealth that was illicit but after that | 2731.72
the shock was rendered lax and lax people job | 2734.839
less after that sir padem also hit that version of the | 2738.76
situation now what are the steps | 2741.48
through you sir I would like to ask the | 2743.4
minister rebel minister that what are  The | 2746.079
Steps in Priority Sector Landing which | 2748.76
is a very important and very | 2751.079
formal formal terminology which has been | 2754.16
used like easy access to credit | 2757.359
marketing while they are the two | 2760.559
major steps which we will give puppets where we will educate them to grow ahead | 2763.0
of  MSME, | 2767.64
especially small enterprises, will not go on the | 2770.24
graph. Thank | 2774.319
you, | 2776.8
Chairman, this is a detailed | 2779.0
question and in this particular question, we | 2783.04
can only say that through MSME, whether it is Aspire | 2787.72
scheme, Spurti scheme or | 2791.52
credit guarantee scheme.  There is a | 2794.079
lot of work that we will do, the | 2796.88
details of which at this time, if we say so, it will | 2799.96
take more time. If they need it, | 2803.0
then we will give it to them in writing | 2805.72
and it should only be assumed | 2808.44
that | 2812.319
through small, micro and medium industries.  The scheme which covers 70 per cent of the population | 2816.96
and we understand that at Hindustan level it is | 2820.52
said that there are | 2823.04
about 70 to 60 per cent people below the poverty line, | 2826.28
work has been done for them only. This is a very important | 2828.319
scheme. Ms. Varsha Gaikwad GG  At the same time, | 2832.079
Honorable Speaker Sir, the | 2835.64
government talks about expanding the MSME sector by expanding the MSC sector, | 2841.68
talks about providing employment to the unemployed, but the government, | 2844.599
which has been presented in the budget, Honorable Speaker | 2847.2
Sir, has given the employment related incentive scheme to | 2849.599
only 500 companies in the budget.  Only | 2852.559
MSMEs have been included in it, whatever is there in it, why has it not been | 2857.2
included, this is not an equal, but an honor, | 2859.28
Mr. Speaker, the previous answer | 2861.52
given by the Honorable Minister, which was | 2864.119
given on 25th in the session, he had said in it | 2871.079
Respected Chairman Sir, if | 2873.319
you see his reply from last week, then Honorable | 2875.76
Chairman Sir, the number of | 2877.64
registrations in the portal is approximately | 2880.16
2.76 crore MSA, out of which | 2884.359
49000 have been registered.  The MSBs which are there are closed and if we | 2887.599
talk about Maharashtra, Honorable Speaker | 2889.599
Sir, out of 44 | 2892.359
4500, Samani Speaker Sir, | 2895.68
our 12000 MSMs are closed, that means out of 45000, | 2898.599
12000 M are closed. | 2908.599
Said that we are working to take | 2911.44
forward this MAC in every field in every way, | 2915.04
like it was said just now, through them | 2922.119
we have registered people worth Rs 4.8 crore on our enterprise portal, in the | 2925.52
same way PM | 2928.8
PMG  Is it a scheme or is it Vishwakarma scheme? By doing this, | 2932.44
we have made a strong effort to provide employment to approximately 20 crore | 2936.319
people. | 2941.0
Sir, therefore, if there is anything more special, then | 2944.079
if we | 2947.28
ask them for an item, we will give it to them.  Question No. | 2950.44
246 Shri Kirti | 2952.72
Azad Kirti Question No. 246 Kirti | 2956.64
Azad Answer tabled Honorable | 2959.76
Member Thank you | 2963.0
Speaker, through you I | 2966.04
would like to tell the Minister that not only I but the entire House is | 2968.16
impressed by the way he works | 2970.079
and I wish if others  If the ministers are also like this then the | 2972.72
country will be saved. | 2974.24
I have asked you this question which is directly | 2978.68
related to West Bengal. I had met you | 2981.92
but I am asking the question on record. I am | 2983.76
thanking you. There are | 2986.2
two such places in my area.  Where there is a | 2989.88
need for vehicle underpass and public underpass, I | 2992.04
would like to know from the Honorable Minister whether a | 3003.2
letter is being written by the Children Welfare Society in Tejganj since the time Swarnim Chaturbhuj was decided here during the time of Atal ji.  Is it and is being | 3006.079
written for that underpass, do | 3007.92
you have any information about it? If so, do | 3011.079
you know that there is a high school, a | 3013.52
hospital, everything there and the | 3016.52
children of the people of Bardhaman city go there and study there.  There is a | 3019.24
plan from your side to make | 3022.24
which I have already requested before you, | 3028.0
Honorable Speaker | 3029.72
Sir, till now | 3032.4
2252 under passes and | 3037.88
11184 over passes have been made in the country. | 3042.799
Whatever he mentioned, | 3045.92
he has discussed it with me. Now we have made a new one.  A | 3050.04
plan has been prepared that when | 3053.48
children cross near the school, a lot of accidents | 3056.28
happen, | 3057.559
so we have discussed what is in it for you. At | 3060.16
some of my places, we have made foot bridges and bridges in such a way | 3063.16
that even scooters and bicycles can go up and people | 3066.72
can get down on foot.  Will be able to go there and if there | 3072.359
will be a lift along with it for the senior citizens, then both will consider the things | 3075.4
and wherever there is a school, they are | 3077.88
worried that there should be no accidents. | 3080.319
This is the permission of Tejganj, | 3085.72
this is already | 3087.44
ordered.  And in this a | 3091.16
foot over bridge will be built as I said | 3097.119
and definitely there is water lodging there too | 3099.96
so we will remove that and lift will | 3104.48
definitely be | 3107.2
made in it. Tell me, I knew that you have given | 3110.559
24 hours notice.  Within that, | 3112.76
second Speaker, I | 3115.079
would like to know supplementary through you that after language poll, there is a | 3117.559
place where there are about 15 Panchayats on one side and | 3121.48
1000 acres of land | 3123.76
lies on the other side of the road and what if there is a | 3127.44
100 or 200 meter move back and forth.  So an | 3129.48
underpass can be built so that farmers | 3131.64
can go and do their farming. You know that | 3133.559
Bardhaman is very famous for rice, a lot of | 3136.319
rice is grown there and is also exported from there | 3138.0
and in a way, India | 3140.319
also gets a lot of food grains from Bardhaman.  So, can it be | 3142.52
built within this language bridge? | 3144.96
We had a meeting in which it was said | 3147.88
that yes, there are possibilities that it can | 3149.96
happen. | 3151.079
Respected Speaker Sir, | 3154.24
I do not have the details of this but when I told our administration | 3158.24
to the officers about this  I say that when a | 3161.04
Member of Parliament comes to us with a problem, | 3163.04
then take it seriously, there is some | 3165.599
problem or the other, that is why he is coming, then what you have | 3168.2
said, today after the completion of the question over, | 3172.28
all the MPs and officers are there, then you also | 3175.28
come.  This is the same problem here and in the | 3181.64
field of language, we are examining it | 3185.16
and will try to solve its problem in this also. | 3188.599
Mr. Etela | 3195.4
Rajendra, thanks to the Chairman. Item: | 3207.319
National Eves construction took place in Telangana State from 1947 to 19204. | 3210.4
Within 10 years, there was more national | 3212.72
construction which took place from Hyderabad to | 3215.52
Vijayawada, Hyderabad to Chhattisgarh, | 3219.96
Hyderabad to Nagpur, Hyderabad to Nagpur, the national | 3223.599
highway construction which took place within the city, a | 3226.72
lot of traffic has increased within Hyderabad city, | 3230.359
many accidents are taking place in it, there are under | 3234.119
passes and roads.  A bus should also be made. | 3238.359
My request to the Minister is that Jodi Metla is speaking | 3241.16
Chowrasta. 60 60 students have died. | 3244.68
6 students from 10 engineering colleges have died. The | 3247.4
Minister said that it is a proactive positive | 3249.799
organization which is definitely ours. | 3253.24
Regarding the two over bridges near Vijayawada National Highway. | 3256.68
And about the National Highway of Chhattisgarh, these | 3259.64
two bridges which are being built | 3264.0
from Kampli to Nagpur, there is | 3267.119
also a metro railway to be built | 3271.68
and now the bridge is being built and sir, if the two are built in coordination then he will be | 3275.359
speaking to the Chief.  It would be | 3284.72
better if the metro rail to be built on Kumli Highway till Medchal is linked, it is a request by speaking, thank you sir, | 3288.359
Honorable Speaker | 3291.16
Sir, I need protection from you, I am | 3295.319
trying to answer but the subject remains the same and the | 3298.0
question is about the whole country.  If you ask, thousands of | 3300.52
crores of rupees are being built, then I do not have the details, | 3302.88
but the Hyderabad Ring Road is a | 3307.44
road worth Rs 1000 crores. We have approved it. | 3310.24
When TRS was in power, they said | 3314.319
that we will do this work and will | 3318.2
give the money for land action after 50 rupees.  I had | 3320.68
also met the new Chief Minister, I have discussed with him also, | 3322.96
we have given him the work, | 3326.28
after completing the action, | 3328.799
we will build the new ring road of Hyderabad, as far as the | 3332.16
road from Vijayawada to Hyderabad is concerned, he | 3336.48
got the airport company.  There is a lot of | 3339.599
dispute and a lot of accidents take place in it. The | 3341.52
former MP | 3345.0
and now PWD minister also | 3347.52
came many times for this and we also discussed with them on that road. They | 3354.72
filed cases against us and NHI, and NHI filed cases against them. | 3357.44
Arbitration High Court has been involved in the case, it is | 3360.2
pending in all these cases but | 3362.92
I know about it that many accidents | 3365.319
happen and I am also saddened by that and in them | 3368.4
freshmen or engineering college boys have also | 3370.559
died.  We have called for the bid for upgradation of | 3373.119
NH 65, which will solve some problem or the other, | 3377.359
and the | 3380.68
work will start immediately within a month or so. | 3383.799
I give them this confidence | 3390.09
[Music] | 3393.48
Done sir, thank you so much sir, NH 66  Ch | 3398.76
starts | 3399.72
from Kasaragod to Trim is one of the | 3403.24
prestigious project of the Government of | 3405.16
India and we all the members of the | 3408.16
parliament are beneficiaries because it is | 3410.48
clearly dividing Kerala into two so the | 3413.2
highway. The 45 meter highway is going to | 3416.72
benefit the people.  Of Kerala sir my | 3419.92
specific | 3421.359
queen the particular highway in my context | 3425.2
from matam to appli there are lot of places that clearly need under | 3429.4
passes there are many | 3433.359
educational institution in cherra lur in | 3436.28
rapura in kun mav rital matam and patnam these are | 3440.359
places that clearly need under  Passes | 3444.16
because and because of people live in areas where it is clearly | 3448.599
divided so we have given a | 3451.4
proposal for constructing new | 3453.48
under passes in this particular N66 also | 3457.4
the Dapli Junction Lallu Junction to Aroor needs an | 3462.799
elevated highway the DPR is already under consideration | 3466.039
so  We request you to alter | 3470.96
the elevated highway because you know land | 3474.4
action Kerala o | 3477.72
particular | 3480.079
sir is 45 meter is not far from adap to | 3484.16
aroor so if you go for land action the extreme | 3488.319
land rates you will be affordable to get the | 3491.68
land and there are  Lot of flats and religious | 3494.0
institution so I request you to | 3495.96
allocate the elevated highway from here to here too. Thank you. What the | 3499.2
honorable member said is | 3504.839
right that it is very | 3506.72
difficult to work in Kerala. There is development on both sides of the road | 3509.44
and land in the middle.  The action cost | 3512.559
of one kilometer goes up to Rs 50 crores, still | 3516.24
they said that the Chief Minister of Kerala will | 3518.64
reduce the cost of land at Rs 50 crores, he | 3521.48
gave Rs 5000 crores, later he faced a | 3524.599
problem, then I gave him a solution | 3526.799
that as much aggregate and  If it costs sand and stones, | 3530.48
make it royalty free and | 3533.52
make it the state's share of GST on Rs. 9. | 3536.839
So let me find a way for you. That | 3539.52
letter from them has just arrived and on the basis of that we are | 3542.4
doing that work because we are building roads in Kerala.  It | 3544.0
is necessary that | 3547.359
I will check what he has said and it is very difficult to take land action | 3550.52
but he will verify the elevated road. | 3562.4
End of question. Honorable members, I have | 3570.28
received adjournment notices from many recognized members. I have not given any notice of adjournment motion. | 3574.52
Permission has not been granted, | 3579.28
will take zero and will take zero first. |
