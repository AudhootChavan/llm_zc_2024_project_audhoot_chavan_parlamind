    "In this notebook, we are going to evaluate our retrieval and rag mechanisms. <br> <br> <br>\n",
    "Retrieval evaluations <br>\n",
    "For this, first we will need is a ground truth dataframe. We will use only a sample of the prepared data as we have around 500 chunks and we will end up spending a lot of open ai credits. And more importantly we will breach the rate limit set by open ai (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits). If you are using an offline llm system, feel free to use the entire dataset. We have taken a sample of 50 chunks for the evaluations. Then we will construct a prompt that will help us create 5 meaningful questions a user could potentially ask the system. To make these questions relevant it is important to feed additional context in the prompt as to the kind of data we are analyzing, typos, accents, inaccuracies etc to expect considering we are working with youtube translated trascripts and errors are to be expected. I used chatgpt to construct this prompt. I generated 5 questions for each chunk in my sample and did some text processing to parse that data and saved it as ground truth data. <br><br>\n",
    "The next step for us is to perform the retrieval and evaluate. I'm using the faiss(Facebook AI Similarity Search) library to perform vector search and sentence transformers library to create embeddings. I have used <b> 2 </b> approaches to evaluate retrieval. First one is to test 2 fields of text in our dataframe and evaluate which would be best to use for retrieval. \n",
    "Second one is to evaluate 3 models of sentence transformers and select the one with best performance. The evaluations will be done using hit rate and mrr as metrics. <br><br><br>\n",
    "RAG evaluations <br>\n",
    "For evaluating the rag, I have used <b> 2 </b> prompts with slight variation. First one is more reliable that will cross reference the web for additional info and second one is more balanced for intuition as well. I have <b> also </b> tested whether there is an impact if we change the number of nearest neighbors from the retrieval system on the quality of answer generated. The quality of rag output is evaluated <b> critically </b> using another prompt and gpt models on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the best. <br><br><br>\n",
